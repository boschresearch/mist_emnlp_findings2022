This	_	_

Conclusions	_	_
To	_	_
conclude	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
results	_	_
presented	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
paper	_	_
have	_	_
demonstrated	_	_
that	_	_
CaP	_	_
fibres	_	_
can	feasibility	_
be	_	_
prepared	_	_
by	_	_
electrospinning	_	_
a	_	_
PLGA-HA	_	_
composite	_	_
solution	_	_
and	_	_
subsequently	_	_
applying	_	_
a	_	_
thermal	_	_
treatment	_	_
at	_	_
sintering	_	_
temperature	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
electrospun	_	_
fibres	_	_
.	_	_

#133
The	_	_
polymer	_	_
phase	_	_
was	_	_
evaporated	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
high	_	_
temperatures	_	_
while	_	_
the	_	_
nanoparticles	_	_
were	_	_
sintered	_	_
,	_	_
allowing	_	_
the	_	_
samples	_	_
to	_	_
retain	_	_
their	_	_
submicrofibrous	_	_
morphology	_	_
.	_	_

#134
Hydroxyapatite	_	_
was	_	_
identified	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
the	_	_
main	_	_
phase	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
treated	_	_
samples	_	_
.	_	_

#135
Tricalcium	_	_
phosphates	_	_
were	_	_
also	_	_
found	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
result	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
dehydroxylation	_	_
and	_	_
decomposition	_	_
of	_	_

#136
The	_	_
chemistry	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
new	_	_
fibres	_	_
holds	_	_
great	_	_
potential	_	_
for	_	_
bone	_	_
tissue	_	_
engineering	_	_
.	_	_

#137
However	_	_
,	_	_
more	_	_
investigations	_	_
are	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
carried	_	_
out	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
particular	_	_
to	_	_
improve	_	_
their	_	_
mechanical	_	_
properties	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
these	_	_
are	_	_
currently	_	_
insufficient	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
fibres	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
used	_	_
as	_	_
bone	_	_
scaffold	_	_
.	_	_

#138
Nevertheless	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
simple	_	_
approach	_	_
is	_	_
promising	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
creation	_	_
of	_	_
submicrofibres	_	_
made	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
wide	_	_
variety	_	_
of	_	_
ceramic	_	_
materials	_	_
without	_	_
the	_	_
use	_	_
of	_	_
toxic	_	_
and	_	_
expensive	_	_
chemical	_	_
