Introduction	_	_
It	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
widely	_	_
accepted	_	_
that	_	_
dislocations	_	_
act	_	_
as	_	_
sinks	_	_
for	_	_
point	_	_
defects	_	_
and	_	_
defect	_	_
clusters	_	_
.	_	_

#10
Especially	_	_
,	_	_
edge	_	_
dislocations	_	_
are	_	_
controlled	_	_
by	_	_
irradiation	_	_
defects	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
interstitial	_	_
bias	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
sink	_	_
[	_	_
1,2	_	_
]	_	_
.	_	_

#11
Edge	_	_
dislocations	_	_
have	_	_
hydrostatic	_	_
stress	_	_
fields	_	_
around	_	_
their	_	_
core	_	_
;	_	_
therefore	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
absorbs	_	_
the	_	_
point	_	_
defects	_	_
easily	_	_
.	_	_

#12
While	_	_
,	_	_
there	_	_
are	_	_
no	_	_
hydrostatic	_	_
stress	_	_
fields	_	_
around	_	_
the	_	_
cores	_	_
of	_	_
screw	_	_
dislocations	_	_
.	_	_

#13
Thus	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
presumed	_	_
that	_	_
a	_	_
driving	_	_
force	_	_
for	_	_
moving	_	_
point	_	_
defects	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
core	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
screw	_	_
dislocation	_	_
does	_	_
not	_	_
exist	_	_
.	_	_

#14
Because	_	_
of	_	_
these	_	_
differences	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
stress	_	_
fields	_	_
around	_	_
the	_	_
cores	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
sink	_	_
strength	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
point	_	_
defect	_	_
is	_	_
thought	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
weaker	_	_
than	_	_
that	_	_
for	_	_
an	_	_
edge	_	_
dislocation	_	_
.	_	_

#15
However	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
mechanism	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
screw	_	_
dislocation	_	_
acting	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
sink	_	_
for	_	_
point	_	_
defects	_	_
can	feasibility	_
be	_	_
found	_	_
indirectly	_	_
,	_	_
e.g.	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
known	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
absorption	_	_
of	_	_
either	_	_
interstitials	_	_
or	_	_
vacancies	_	_
at	_	_
a	_	_
screw	_	_
dislocation	_	_
changes	_	_
it	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
helical	_	_
dislocation	_	_
having	_	_
partial	_	_
edge	_	_
component	_	_
[	_	_

]	_	_
.	_	_

#16
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
core	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
screw	_	_
dislocation	_	_
is	_	_
considered	_	_
to	_	_
form	_	_
kinks	_	_
or	_	_
jogs	_	_
with	_	_
an	_	_
edge	_	_
component	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
shows	_	_
interstitial	_	_
bias	_	_
.	_	_

#17
Such	_	_
kinks	_	_
or	_	_
jogs	_	_
would	_	_
enhance	_	_
the	_	_
transformation	_	_
from	_	_
screw	_	_
to	_	_
helical	_	_
dislocation	_	_
.	_	_

#18
Irradiation	_	_

caused	_	_

such	_	_
increase	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
edge	_	_

#19
This	_	_
increase	_	_
results	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
large	_	_
degree	_	_
of	_	_
softening	_	_
in	_	_
bcc	_	_
metals	_	_
because	_	_
the	_	_

In	_	_

are	_	_
considered	_	_
to	_	_
have	_	_
a	_	_
significant	_	_
influence	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
formation	_	_
of	_	_
