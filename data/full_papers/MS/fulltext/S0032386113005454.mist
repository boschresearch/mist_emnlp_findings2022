Introduction	_	_
Epoxy	_	_
polymers	_	_
are	_	_
a	_	_
class	_	_
of	_	_
high-performance	_	_
thermosetting	_	_
polymers	_	_
which	_	_
are	_	_
widely	_	_
used	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
matrices	_	_
of	_	_
fibre-reinforced	_	_
composite	_	_
materials	_	_
and	_	_
as	_	_
adhesives	_	_
.	_	_

#20
They	_	_
are	_	_
known	_	_
for	_	_
their	_	_
excellent	_	_
engineering	_	_
properties	_	_
,	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
high	_	_
modulus	_	_
,	_	_
low	_	_
creep	_	_
,	_	_
high	_	_
strength	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
good	_	_
thermal	_	_
and	_	_
dimensional	_	_
stabilities	_	_
.	_	_

#21
However	_	_
,	_	_
epoxy	_	_
polymers	_	_
have	_	_
inherently	_	_
low	_	_
toughness	_	_
and	_	_
impact	_	_
resistance	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
their	_	_
highly	_	_
crosslinked	_	_
structure	_	_
.	_	_

#22
This	_	_
structure	_	_
leads	_	_
to	_	_
brittle	_	_
behaviour	_	_
and	_	_
causes	_	_
the	_	_
polymers	_	_
to	_	_
suffer	_	_
from	_	_
relatively	_	_
poor	_	_
resistance	_	_
to	_	_
crack	_	_
initiation	_	_
and	_	_
growth	_	_

#23
To	_	_
improve	_	_
the	_	_
toughness	_	_
of	_	_
epoxy	_	_
polymers	_	_

it	_	_

#26
Here	_	_
the	_	_
rubber	_	_

about	_	_
0.1-5	_	_

#27
The	_	_
particles	_	_
are	_	_
typically	_	_
well-dispersed	_	_

and	_	_
formed	_	_
by	_	_
reaction-induced	_	_
phase-separation	_	_

#28
However	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
particle	_	_
size	_	_
is	_	_
difficult	_	_
to	_	_
control	_	_
as	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
dependent	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
curing	_	_
conditions	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
hence	_	_
can	feasibility	negation
not	_	_
be	_	_
varied	_	_
systematically	_	_
without	_	_
changing	_	_

properties	_	_

epoxy	_	_

alternative	_	_
route	_	_

to	_	_

it	_	_

A	_	_

these	_	_

#274
The	_	_

#275
Further	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
found	_	_
previously	_	_
[	_	_

]	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
predicts	_	_
that	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
relatively	_	_

concentrations	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
S-CSR	_	_

#276
This	_	_
arises	_	_
because	_	_
,	_	_
firstly	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
S-CSR	_	_
particles	_	_
still	_	_
act	_	_
as	_	_
points	_	_
of	_	_
stress	_	_

such	_	_

to	_	_
their	_	_
lower	_	_
modulus	_	_

the	_	_
epoxy	_	_
polymer	_	_

the	_	_
complete	_	_

#277
In	_	_
contrast	_	_
,	_	_
secondly	_	_
,	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
relatively	_	_
low	_	_
test	_	_
temperatures	_	_
the	_	_
S-CSR	_	_

are	_	_
now	_	_
longer	_	_
truly	_	_
rubbery	_	_
in	_	_
nature	_	_
and	_	_
,	_	_
therefore	_	_
,	_	_
cavitation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_

which	_	_
then	_	_
enables	_	_
subsequent	_	_

#278
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
clear	_	_
feature	_	_
that	_	_

that	_	_
the	_	_
