For	_	_
a	_	_
given	_	_
generation	_	_
rate	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
minority	_	_
carrier	_	_
lifetime	_	_
is	_	_
largely	_	_
determined	_	_
by	_	_
recombination	_	_
processes	_	_

#16
Some	_	_

by	_	_

in	_	_
the	_	_
bulk	_	_
or	_	_
at	_	_
surfaces	_	_

#17
It	_	_
is	_	_
necessary	_	_
to	_	_
understand	_	_
which	_	_
defects	_	_
are	_	_
typically	_	_
present	_	_
in	_	_
solar	_	_

what	_	_
effect	_	_

has	_	_
on	_	_
those	_	_
defects	_	_

#18
Moreover	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
important	_	_
to	_	_
understand	_	_
the	_	_
mechanism	_	_
by	_	_
which	_	_
the	_	_
relevant	_	_
defects	_	_
give	_	_
rise	_	_
to	_	_

Monocrystalline	_	_

oxygen	_	_
is	_	_
supersaturated	_	_

∼1200°C	_	_

so	_	_
the	_	_
equilibrium	_	_

#257
This	_	_
is	_	_
very	_	_
encouraging	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
perspective	_	_
of	_	_
solar	_	_
wafers	_	_
containing	_	_

and	_	_
suggests	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_

not	_	_
increase	_	_
(	_	_

The	_	_

#261
An	_	_
explanation	_	_
for	_	_
this	_	_

that	_	_
this	_	_
