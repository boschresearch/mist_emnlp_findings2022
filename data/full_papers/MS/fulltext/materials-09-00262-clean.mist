Introduction	_	_
The	_	_
use	_	_
of	_	_
fillers	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
enhancement	_	_
of	_	_
polymer	_	_
properties	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
well	_	_
documented	_	_
.	_	_

#9
Initially	_	_
,	_	_
fillers	_	_
were	_	_
used	_	_
to	_	_
reduce	_	_
the	_	_
cost	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
polymeric	_	_
products	_	_
.	_	_

#10
However	_	_
,	_	_
with	_	_
time	_	_
,	_	_
fillers	_	_
became	_	_
an	_	_
integral	_	_
part	_	_
in	_	_
many	_	_
applications	_	_
,	_	_
particularly	_	_
for	_	_
reinforcing	_	_
the	_	_
mechanical	_	_
properties	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
polymer	_	_
.	_	_

#11
“Reinforced”	_	_
polymers	_	_
consist	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
polymeric	_	_
matrix	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
relatively	_	_
stiff	_	_
inorganic	_	_
filler	_	_
that	_	_
undergoes	_	_
dramatic	_	_
change	_	_
in	_	_
modulus	_	_
or	_	_
stress	_	_
at	_	_
given	_	_
strain	_	_
over	_	_
the	_	_
pure	_	_
polymer	_	_

Traditional	_	_

and	_	_
calcium	_	_
carbonate	_	_
particles	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
micrometer	_	_
range	_	_
.	_	_

#13
However	_	_
,	_	_
most	_	_
micron	_	_
sized	_	_
traditional	_	_
fillers	_	_
require	_	_
high	_	_
loading	_	_
for	_	_
modest	_	_
property	_	_
enhancement	_	_
,	_	_
causing	_	_
problems	_	_
in	_	_
melt	_	_
flow	_	_
and	_	_
processing	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
high	_	_
viscosity	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
filled	_	_
materials	_	_
.	_	_

#14
Furthermore	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
high	_	_
density	_	_
of	_	_
traditional	_	_
fillers	_	_
also	_	_
leads	_	_
to	_	_
heavier	_	_
composites	_	_

#15
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
lack	_	_
of	_	_
interfacial	_	_
interaction	_	_
between	_	_
the	_	_
filler	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
polymeric	_	_
matrix	_	_
leads	_	_
to	_	_
weak	_	_
interfacial	_	_
adhesion	_	_
and	_	_
results	_	_
in	_	_
failure	_	_
.	_	_

#16
A	_	_
broad	_	_
diversity	_	_
of	_	_

been	_	_
used	_	_

The	_	_

between	_	_
