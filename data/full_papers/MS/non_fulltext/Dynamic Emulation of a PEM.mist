The	_	_

#430
The	_	_
novelty	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_

In	_	_
this	_	_
specific	_	_
operating	_	_
case	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
electrolyzer	_	_
behaves	_	_
like	_	_
a	_	_
capacitor	_	_
.	_	_

#444
The	_	_
novelty	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
paper	_	_
was	_	_
to	_	_
assess	_	_
the	_	_
methodology	_	_
for	_	_
identifying	_	_
the	_	_
exponential	_	_

on	_	_

For	_	_
this	_	_
reason	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
limited	_	_

was	_	_

#446
Even	_	_
if	_	_

considered	_	_
lower	_	_
current	_	_
densities	_	_
compared	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
literature	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
had	_	_
the	_	_
merit	_	_
of	_	_
assessing	_	_
a	_	_
methodology	_	_
that	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
applied	_	_
in	_	_

#447
Furthermore	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_

can	_	_
be	_	_
employed	_	_
to	_	_
test	_	_
the	_	_

,	_	_
the	_	_
parameters	_	_

The	_	_
comparison	_	_

In	_	_

In	_	_
