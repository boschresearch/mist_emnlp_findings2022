The	_	_
Architectures	_	_

LiDAR	_	_
with	_	_
1D	_	_
MEMS	_	_
Mirrors	_	_
A	_	_
3D	_	_
LiDAR	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
built	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
1D	_	_
MEMS	_	_
mirror	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
diffused	_	_
laser	_	_
beam	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
shown	_	_
in	_	_
Figure	_	_
4a	_	_
[	_	_

and	_	_
also	_	_
found	_	_

#232
The	_	_
horizontally	_	_
scanned	_	_
beam	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
MEMS	_	_
mirror	_	_
is	_	_
diffused	_	_
into	_	_
a	_	_

line	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
diffuser	_	_
lens	_	_
[	_	_

.	_	_

#233
Thus	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
scanning	_	_
beam	_	_
can	_	_
cover	_	_
both	_	_
the	_	_
vertical	_	_
and	_	_
horizontal	_	_
direction	_	_
.	_	_

#234
The	_	_
horizontal	_	_
resolution	_	_
in	_	_
pixels	_	_
is	_	_
determined	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
measurement	_	_
sampling	_	_
rate	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
MEMS	_	_
mirror	_	_
scanning	_	_
frequency	_	_
.	_	_

#235
A	_	_
photodetector	_	_
(	_	_
PD	_	_
)	_	_
1D	_	_
array	_	_
is	_	_
parallel	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
diffused	_	_
laser	_	_
line	_	_
and	_	_
its	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_
PD	_	_
elements	_	_
determines	_	_
the	_	_
vertical	_	_
resolution	_	_
.	_	_

#236
High	_	_
vertical	_	_
resolution	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
achieved	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
cost	_	_

a	_	_
large	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_

elements	_	_
.	_	_

#237
Another	_	_
common	_	_
issue	_	_
with	_	_
this	_	_
LiDAR	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
maximum	_	_
detection	_	_
distance	_	_
is	_	_
short	_	_
.	_	_

#238
The	_	_
first	_	_
reason	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
power	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
laser	_	_
is	_	_
distributed	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
line	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
results	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
low	_	_
optical	_	_
power	_	_
density	_	_
.	_	_

#239
The	_	_
second	_	_
reason	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
each	_	_
PD	_	_
element	_	_
has	_	_
an	_	_
acceptance	_	_
angle	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
horizontal	_	_
direction	_	_
as	_	_
wide	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
scanning	_	_
angle	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
MEMS	_	_
mirror	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
sacrifices	_	_
the	_	_
SNR	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
detected	_	_
signal	_	_
.	_	_

#240
A	_	_
similar	_	_
architecture	_	_
uses	_	_
an	_	_
array	_	_
of	_	_
laser	_	_
sources	_	_
to	_	_
form	_	_
the	_	_
vertical	_	_
scanning	_	_
lines	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
1D	_	_
MEMS	_	_
mirror	_	_
to	_	_
scan	_	_
the	_	_
vertical	_	_
lines	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
horizontal	_	_
direction	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
2D	_	_

problems	_	_

The	_	_

the	_	_
