that	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
homogeneous	_	_
soil	_	_
,	_	_
P.	_	_

roots	_	_
increased	_	_
aggregate	_	_
size	_	_

)	_	_
and	_	_
aggregate	_	_
stability	_	_
(	_	_
MWD	_	_
)	_	_
irrespective	_	_
of	_	_
whether	_	_
roots	_	_
were	_	_
mycorrhizal	_	_

AMF	_	_

had	_	_
no	_	_

effect	_	_
on	_	_

Porosity	_	_
and	_	_
pore	_	_
size	_	_
distribution	_	_
were	_	_
affected	_	_
by	_	_

fungal	_	_
species	_	_
;	_	_
in	_	_
particular	_	_
G.	_	_
mosseae	_	_

produced	_	_
a	_	_
more	_	_

has	_	_
the	_	_
greatest	_	_
influence	_	_
on	_	_
these	_	_
