Abstract	_	_
This	_	_
paper	_	_
presents	_	_
a	_	_
water	_	_
resources	_	_
management	_	_
strategy	_	_
developed	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
Brazilian	_	_
National	_	_
Water	_	_
Agency	_	_
(	_	_
ANA	_	_
)	_	_
to	_	_
cope	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
conflicts	_	_
between	_	_
water	_	_
users	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
Verde	_	_
Grande	_	_
River	_	_
basin	_	_
,	_	_
located	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
southern	_	_
border	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
Brazilian	_	_
semi-arid	_	_
region	_	_
.	_	_

#3
The	_	_
basin	_	_
is	_	_
dominated	_	_
by	_	_
water-demanding	_	_
fruit	_	_
irrigation	_	_
agriculture	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
has	_	_
grown	_	_
significantly	_	_
and	_	_
without	_	_
adequate	_	_
water	_	_
use	_	_
control	_	_
,	_	_
over	_	_
the	_	_
last	_	_
30	_	_
years	_	_
.	_	_

#4
The	_	_
current	_	_
water	_	_
demand	_	_
for	_	_
irrigation	_	_
exceeds	_	_
water	_	_
availability	_	_
(	_	_
understood	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
95	_	_
%	_	_
percentile	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
flow	_	_
duration	_	_
curve	_	_
)	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
ratio	_	_
of	_	_
three	_	_
to	_	_
one	_	_
,	_	_
meaning	_	_
that	_	_
downstream	_	_
water	_	_
users	_	_
are	_	_
experiencing	_	_
more	_	_
frequent	_	_
water	_	_
shortages	_	_
than	_	_
upstream	_	_
ones	_	_
.	_	_

#5
The	_	_
management	_	_
strategy	_	_
implemented	_	_
in	_	_
2008	_	_
has	_	_
the	_	_
objective	_	_
of	_	_
equalizing	_	_
risk	_	_
for	_	_
all	_	_
water	_	_
users	_	_
and	_	_
consists	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
set	_	_
of	_	_
rules	_	_
designed	_	_
to	_	_
restrict	_	_
water	_	_
withdrawals	_	_
according	_	_
to	_	_
current	_	_
river	_	_
water	_	_
level	_	_
(	_	_
indicative	_	_
of	_	_
water	_	_
availability	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
water	_	_
demand	_	_
.	_	_

#6
Under	_	_
that	_	_
rule	_	_
,	_	_
larger	_	_
farmers	_	_
have	_	_
proportionally	_	_
larger	_	_
reductions	_	_
in	_	_
water	_	_
use	_	_
,	_	_
preserving	_	_
small	_	_
subsistence	_	_
irrigators	_	_
.	_	_

#7
Moreover	_	_
,	_	_
dry	_	_
season	_	_
streamflow	_	_
is	_	_
forecasted	_	_
at	_	_
strategic	_	_
points	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
end	_	_
of	_	_
every	_	_
rainy	_	_
season	_	_
,	_	_
providing	_	_
evaluation	_	_
of	_	_
shortage	_	_
risk	_	_
.	_	_

#8
Thus	_	_
,	_	_
water	_	_
users	_	_
are	_	_
informed	_	_
about	_	_
the	_	_
forecasts	_	_
and	_	_
corresponding	_	_
restrictions	_	_
well	_	_
in	_	_
advance	_	_
,	_	_
allowing	_	_
for	_	_
anticipated	_	_
planning	_	_
of	_	_
irrigated	_	_
areas	_	_
and	_	_
practices	_	_
.	_	_

#9
In	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
enforce	_	_
restriction	_	_
rules	_	_
,	_	_
water	_	_
meters	_	_
were	_	_
installed	_	_
in	_	_
all	_	_
larger	_	_
water	_	_
users	_	_
and	_	_
inefficient	_	_
farmers	_	_
were	_	_
obligated	_	_
to	_	_
improve	_	_
their	_	_
irrigation	_	_
systems’	_	_
performance	_	_
.	_	_

#10
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
increases	_	_
in	_	_
irrigated	_	_
area	_	_
are	_	_
only	_	_
allowed	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
case	_	_
of	_	_
annual	_	_
crops	_	_
and	_	_
during	_	_
months	_	_
of	_	_
higher	_	_
water	_	_
availability	_	_
(	_	_
November	_	_
to	_	_
June	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#11
The	_	_
strategy	_	_
differs	_	_
from	_	_
convectional	_	_
approached	_	_
based	_	_
only	_	_
on	_	_
water	_	_
use	_	_
priority	_	_
and	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
successful	_	_
in	_	_
dealing	_	_
with	_	_
natural	_	_
variability	_	_
of	_	_
water	_	_
availability	_	_
,	_	_
allowing	_	_
more	_	_
water	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
used	_	_
in	_	_
wet	_	_
years	_	_
and	_	_

#27
In	_	_
practical	_	_

as	_	_

#28
At	_	_
the	_	_
federal	_	_
level	_	_
,	_	_
ANA	_	_
generally	_	_
sets	_	_
the	_	_

95	_	_

,	_	_
as	_	_
proposed	_	_
by	_	_
Dingman	_	_
(	_	_
2002	_	_

,	_	_
which	_	_
is	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_
considered	_	_
an	_	_
acceptable	_	_
level	_	_
of	_	_
risk	_	_
,	_	_
since	_	_
most	_	_

#31
In	_	_
some	_	_

#61
A	_	_
first	_	_

#74
Imposing	_	_
water	_	_

the	_	_
social	_	_

#76
Moreover	_	_
,	_	_

the	_	_

#89
In	_	_
the	_	_

,	_	_
it	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
difficult	_	_

the	_	_

#92
In	_	_
2013	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_

#100
This	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_

true	_	_
for	_	_

whole	_	_

#101
Approximately	_	_
300	_	_

were	_	_
not	_	_
allowed	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
implemented	_	_

#102
However	_	_
,	_	_
high	_	_
seasonality	_	_
of	_	_
flows	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
river	_	_
means	_	_
that	_	_
irrigation	_	_
is	_	_
possible	_	_
during	_	_
noncritical	_	_
months	_	_
,	_	_
typically	_	_
November	_	_
to	_	_
June	_	_
.	_	_

#103
In	_	_
this	_	_
period	_	_
,	_	_
even	_	_
with	_	_
higher	_	_
mean	_	_
rainfall	_	_
,	_	_
irrigation	_	_
is	_	_
still	_	_
needed	_	_
because	_	_
of	_	_
high	_	_
evaporation	_	_
rates	_	_

#104
Moreover	_	_
,	_	_
small	_	_
periods	_	_
of	_	_
up	_	_
to	_	_
two	_	_
weeks	_	_

Thus	_	_
,	_	_
water	_	_
rights	_	_
requests	_	_
for	_	_

are	_	_

of	_	_

#113
Nevertheless	_	_

enforcement	_	_

the	_	_

In	_	_

Also	_	_
,	_	_

The	_	_
