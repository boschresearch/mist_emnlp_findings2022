#152
One	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
main	_	_
objectives	_	_
of	_	_
this	_	_
research	_	_
was	_	_
to	_	_
explore	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_

#153
The	_	_

was	_	_
calibrated	_	_
purely	_	_
against	_	_

to	_	_
the	_	_

a	_	_

obtain	_	_

first	_	_
approximation	_	_
of	_	_
model	_	_
parameters	_	_
,	_	_
(	_	_
2	_	_
)	_	_
an	_	_
automatic	_	_
calibration	_	_
based	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
combined	_	_
use	_	_
of	_	_
EOFs	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
genetic	_	_

in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
refine	_	_
model	_	_
parameterization	_	_
and	_	_

)	_	_

carried	_	_

both	_	_
remote	_	_

and	_	_
traditional	_	_
data	_	_
(	_	_
such	_	_

#154
Since	_	_
the	_	_
meteorological	_	_
data	_	_
(	_	_
precipitation	_	_

temperature	_	_
)	_	_
were	_	_
available	_	_
from	_	_
1960	_	_
to	_	_
2003	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
MODIS	_	_
NDVI	_	_
was	_	_
available	_	_
from	_	_
2000	_	_
to	_	_
present	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
decided	_	_
to	_	_
use	_	_
the	_	_
year	_	_
2003	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
calibration	_	_
period	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
period	_	_
from	_	_
2000	_	_
to	_	_
2002	_	_
for	_	_
validation	_	_
.	_	_

#155
In	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
avoid	_	_
the	_	_
effect	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
initial	_	_
conditions	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
used	_	_
one	_	_
year	_	_
as	_	_
warming-up	_	_
period	_	_
(	_	_
the	_	_
year	_	_
2002	_	_
and	_	_
1999	_	_
for	_	_
model	_	_
calibration	_	_
and	_	_
validation	_	_
,	_	_
respectively	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#156
For	_	_
these	_	_
purposes	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
adopted	_	_
the	_	_
NDVI	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
descriptor	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
state	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
vegetation	_	_
assuming	_	_
that	_	_

are	_	_

have	_	_
led	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
general	_	_
conclusion	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
spectral	_	_

such	_	_

have	_	_
considerable	_	_

behavior	_	_
was	_	_

observed	_	_
when	_	_

#360
Two	_	_
reasons	_	_
could	_	_
explain	_	_
such	_	_
results	_	_
.	_	_

#361
First	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
observed	_	_
NDVI	_	_
in	_	_
some	_	_
cells	_	_
of	_	_
those	_	_
areas	_	_
had	_	_
a	_	_
really	_	_
bad	_	_
quality	_	_
as	_	_
testified	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
unrealistic	_	_
oscillations	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
NDVI	_	_
from	_	_
0.8	_	_
to	_	_
0.1	_	_
(	_	_
even	_	_
zero	_	_
)	_	_
in	_	_
just	_	_
one	_	_
week	_	_
.	_	_

#362
These	_	_
unrealistic	_	_
oscillations	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_
produced	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
presence	_	_
of	_	_
clouds	_	_
over	_	_
the	_	_
area	_	_
near	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
mountains	_	_
.	_	_

#363
The	_	_
second	_	_
reason	_	_
is	_	_
related	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
conceptual	_	_
limitation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
model	_	_
.	_	_

#364
The	_	_
TETIS-VEG	_	_
was	_	_
designed	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
used	_	_
only	_	_
in	_	_
water-controlled	_	_
areas	_	_
.	_	_

#365
Franz	_	_
(	_	_
2007	_	_
)	_	_
analyzed	_	_
the	_	_
correlation	_	_
between	_	_
the	_	_
fractional	_	_

cover	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
mean	_	_
annual	_	_
precipitation	_	_
within	_	_
the	_	_
catchment	_	_
and	_	_
they	_	_
were	_	_
strongly	_	_
correlated	_	_
.	_	_

#366
However	_	_
,	_	_
two	_	_
different	_	_
slopes	_	_
were	_	_
observed	_	_
.	_	_

#367
The	_	_
transition	_	_
point	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
indicates	_	_
when	_	_
water	_	_
availability	_	_
had	_	_
a	_	_
smaller	_	_
influence	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
fractional	_	_
woody	_	_
cover	_	_
,	_	_
occurred	_	_
approximately	_	_
around	_	_
800	_	_

.	_	_

#368
Physically	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
transition	_	_
point	_	_
is	_	_
believed	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
a	_	_
good	_	_
approximation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
transition	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
water-controlled	_	_
ecosystem	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
nutrientcontrolled	_	_
ecosystem	_	_
.	_	_

#369
This	_	_
approach	_	_
allowed	_	_
us	_	_
to	_	_
define	_	_
the	_	_
higher	_	_
areas	_	_
within	_	_
the	_	_
study	_	_

(	_	_
where	_	_

#370
With	_	_
the	_	_
exemption	_	_
of	_	_
these	_	_

,	_	_
a	_	_
strong	_	_

existed	_	_

the	_	_

captured	_	_
the	_	_
temporal	_	_
dynamic	_	_
of	_	_
LAI	_	_
.	_	_

#371
However	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
did	_	_
not	_	_
necessarily	_	_
mean	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
magnitude	_	_
of	_	_
LAI	_	_
was	_	_
reasonable	_	_
.	_	_

#372
This	_	_
last	_	_
point	_	_
was	_	_
proven	_	_
by	_	_
calculating	_	_
the	_	_
good	_	_
performance	_	_
in	_	_
terms	_	_
of	_	_
spatial	_	_

and	_	_
the	_	_
comparison	_	_
between	_	_
the	_	_
gradient	_	_
maps	_	_
.	_	_

#373
No	_	_
differences	_	_

were	_	_

#381
This	_	_
limitation	_	_
is	_	_
obvious	_	_
since	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
parameters	_	_

NDVI	_	_

,	_	_
the	_	_

#382
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
direct	_	_
comparison	_	_
between	_	_

should	_	_
not	_	_

it	_	_

Conclusions	_	_

#391
The	_	_
main	_	_
two	_	_
objectives	_	_
of	_	_
this	_	_
research	_	_
were	_	_
(	_	_
1	_	_
)	_	_
to	_	_
explore	_	_
if	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
possible	_	_
to	_	_
calibrate	_	_
and	_	_
validate	_	_
an	_	_
ecohydrological	_	_
model	_	_
using	_	_
only	_	_
satellite	_	_
information	_	_
and	_	_
(	_	_
2	_	_
)	_	_
to	_	_
incorporate	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
data	_	_
about	_	_
a	_	_
model	_	_
state	_	_
variable	_	_
into	_	_
the	_	_
automatic	_	_
calibration	_	_
process	_	_
.	_	_

#392
In	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
tackle	_	_
these	_	_
challenges	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
parsimonious	_	_
distributed	_	_
ecohydrological	_	_
model	_	_
was	_	_
calibrated	_	_
by	_	_
exclusively	_	_
using	_	_
NDVI	_	_
data	_	_
provided	_	_
by	_	_
MODIS	_	_
.	_	_

#393
A	_	_
methodology	_	_
based	_	_
on	_	_
EOF	_	_
analysis	_	_
was	_	_
proposed	_	_
to	_	_
carry	_	_
out	_	_
manual	_	_
and	_	_
automatic	_	_
calibration	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
.	_	_

#394
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
results	_	_
were	_	_
validated	_	_
using	_	_
satellite	_	_
data	_	_
referring	_	_
to	_	_
different	_	_
periods	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
observed	_	_
discharge	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
basin	_	_
outlet	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
was	_	_
not	_	_
used	_	_
for	_	_
calibration	_	_
.	_	_

#395
In	_	_
general	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
model	_	_
was	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
properly	_	_
reproduce	_	_
the	_	_
vegetation	_	_
dynamics	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
observed	_	_
stream	_	_
flow	_	_
.	_	_

#396
The	_	_
results	_	_
highlight	_	_
the	_	_
usefulness	_	_
of	_	_
satellite	_	_
data	_	_
.	_	_

#397
It	_	_
was	_	_
possible	_	_
to	_	_
implement	_	_
the	_	_
hydrological	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
vegetation	_	_
components	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
TETIS-VEG	_	_
daily	_	_
model	_	_
using	_	_
only	_	_
NDVI	_	_
data	_	_
and	_	_
also	_	_
to	_	_
validate	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
with	_	_
satisfactory	_	_
results	_	_
.	_	_

#398
Such	_	_
outcomes	_	_
are	_	_
promising	_	_
because	_	_
they	_	_
demonstrate	_	_
that	_	_
satellite	_	_
data	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_
exploited	_	_
in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
predict	_	_
river	_	_
discharge	_	_
in	_	_
ungauged	_	_
basins	_	_
.	_	_

#399
More	_	_
specifically	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
expect	_	_
this	_	_
result	_	_
given	_	_
the	_	_
key	_	_
role	_	_
played	_	_
by	_	_
vegetation	_	_
in	_	_
water-controlled	_	_
areas	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
upper	_	_
Ewaso	_	_
Ngiro	_	_
river	_	_
basin	_	_
in	_	_
Kenya	_	_
,	_	_
where	_	_
having	_	_
an	_	_
appropriate	_	_
description	_	_
of	_	_
vegetation	_	_
and	_	_
transpiration	_	_
is	_	_
critical	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
correct	_	_
description	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_
balance	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
local	_	_
and	_	_
basin	_	_
scale	_	_
.	_	_

#400
The	_	_
proposed	_	_
automatic	_	_
calibration	_	_
was	_	_
completely	_	_
designed	_	_
to	_	_
incorporate	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
data	_	_
in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
take	_	_
maximum	_	_
advantage	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
available	_	_
satellite	_	_
data	_	_
.	_	_

#401
After	_	_
calibrating	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
simulated	_	_
vegetation	_	_
patterns	_	_
display	_	_
good	_	_
agreement	_	_
with	_	_
measured	_	_
NDVI	_	_
in	_	_
most	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
basin	_	_
except	_	_
for	_	_
some	_	_
portions	_	_
at	_	_
higher	_	_
altitudes	_	_
.	_	_

#402
This	_	_
non-satisfactory	_	_
result	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
bad	_	_
quality	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
NDVI	_	_
data	_	_
and/or	_	_
the	_	_
limitation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
vegetation	_	_
sub-model	_	_
(	_	_
that	_	_
was	_	_
specifically	_	_
designed	_	_
for	_	_
semiarid	_	_
regions	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#403
Model	_	_
limitations	_	_
along	_	_
with	_	_
poor	_	_
data	_	_
quality	_	_
and	_	_
resolution	_	_
negatively	_	_
affected	_	_
the	_	_
overall	_	_
model	_	_
performance	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
procedure	_	_
allowed	_	_
us	_	_
to	_	_
exploit	_	_
the	_	_
amount	_	_
of	_	_
information	_	_
available	_	_
addressing	_	_
the	_	_
critical	_	_
issue	_	_
of	_	_
identifying	_	_
a	_	_
procedure	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
calibration	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
distributed	_	_
model	_	_
.	_	_

#404
This	_	_
allowed	_	_
us	_	_
to	_	_
obtain	_	_
a	_	_
correct	_	_
description	_	_
of	_	_
vegetation	_	_
dynamics	_	_
in	_	_
space	_	_
and	_	_
time	_	_
also	_	_
providing	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
marginal	_	_
benefit	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
fairly	_	_
good	_	_
streamflow	_	_
prediction	_	_
.	_	_

#405
In	_	_
this	_	_
context	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
was	_	_
mandatory	_	_
to	_	_
adopt	_	_
a	_	_
daily	_	_
time	_	_
step	_	_
in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
have	_	_
a	_	_
coherence	_	_
with	_	_
satellite	_	_
NDVI	_	_
data	_	_
and	_	_
also	_	_
removing	_	_
the	_	_
need	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
runoff	_	_
propagation	_	_
module	_	_
in	_	_
our	_	_
model	_	_
.	_	_

#406
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
should	_	_
consider	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
potential	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
present	_	_
study	_	_
is	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
large	_	_
availability	_	_
of	_	_
remote	_	_
sensing	_	_
information	_	_
(	_	_
not	_	_
only	_	_
satellite	_	_
)	_	_
concerning	_	_
spatial	_	_
state	_	_
variables	_	_
and	_	_
more	_	_
information	_	_
will	_	_
be	_	_
available	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
future	_	_
.	_	_

#407
Many	_	_
efforts	_	_
are	_	_
being	_	_
made	_	_
to	_	_
improve	_	_
the	_	_
quality	_	_
and	_	_
quantity	_	_
of	_	_
remote	_	_
sensing	_	_
data	_	_
(	_	_
drones	_	_
,	_	_
better	_	_
devices	_	_
,	_	_
etc.	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#408
Additionally	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
scientific	_	_
community	_	_
must	deontic	_
also	_	_
be	_	_
ready	_	_
to	_	_
exploit	_	_
the	_	_
enormous	_	_
amount	_	_
of	_	_
information	_	_
contained	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
data	_	_
(	_	_
temporal	_	_
,	_	_
spatial	_	_
and	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#409
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
should	_	_
identify	_	_
the	_	_
best	_	_
way	_	_
to	_	_
use	_	_
all	_	_
