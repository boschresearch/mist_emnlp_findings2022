Introduction	_	_
Durum	_	_
wheat	_	_
(	_	_
Triticum	_	_

is	_	_
a	_	_
crop	_	_

cultivated	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
production	_	_

A	_	_
high	_	_
level	_	_

proteins	_	_
confers	_	_
properties	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
grains	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
valued	_	_

Conclusion	_	_
This	_	_
study	_	_
provides	_	_
clues	_	_
about	_	_
the	_	_
mechanisms	_	_
of	_	_
action	_	_
of	_	_
DPI4913	_	_
and	_	_
AF086	_	_
biostimulants	_	_
on	_	_
durum	_	_
wheat	_	_
,	_	_
biostimulants	_	_
that	_	_
positively	_	_
affect	_	_

Both	_	_
biostimulants	_	_
improved	_	_
yield	_	_
(	_	_

,	_	_
and	_	_
N	_	_
recovery	_	_
in	_	_
whole	_	_
plants	_	_
at	_	_

enhanced	_	_

#247
However	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
effect	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
fungal	_	_
biostimulant	_	_
AF086	_	_
was	_	_
less	_	_
pronounced	_	_
than	_	_
that	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
marine	_	_
biostimulant	_	_
DPI4913	_	_

#248
A	_	_
higher	_	_
amount	_	_
of	_	_
N	_	_
recovered	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
crop	_	_
would	_	_
result	_	_
in	_	_
less	_	_
N	_	_
leaching	_	_
if	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
amount	_	_
of	_	_
N	_	_
fertilizer	_	_

applied	_	_
,	_	_
positively	_	_

Because	_	_
biostimulants	_	_

the	_	_

the	_	_
flag-leaf	_	_
recovered	_	_
in	_	_
grains	_	_
at	_	_
harvest	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
relevant	_	_
to	_	_
evaluate	_	_
the	_	_
interest	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
use	_	_
of	_	_
biostimulants	_	_
in	_	_
combination	_	_
with	_	_
foliar	_	_
application	_	_
of	_	_
N	_	_
on	_	_
