In	_	_
old	_	_
and	_	_
heavily	_	_
weathered	_	_
soils	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
availability	_	_
of	_	_
P	_	_
might	_	_
be	_	_
so	_	_
small	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
primary	_	_
production	_	_
of	_	_
plants	_	_
is	_	_
limited	_	_
.	_	_

#8
However	_	_
,	_	_
plants	_	_
have	_	_
evolved	_	_
several	_	_
mechanisms	_	_
to	_	_
actively	_	_
take	_	_
up	_	_
P	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_

it	_	_
to	_	_
overcome	_	_
this	_	_
limitation	_	_

These	_	_

The	_	_
objective	_	_
of	_	_
this	_	_

is	_	_
to	_	_
investigate	_	_
how	_	_

To	_	_
do	_	_

we	_	_

We	_	_

Furthermore	_	_

Phosphorus	_	_
(	_	_
P	_	_
)	_	_
is	_	_
an	_	_
essential	_	_
nutrient	_	_
for	_	_
life	_	_
and	_	_
its	_	_
availability	_	_
ultimately	_	_
constrains	_	_
the	_	_
production	_	_
of	_	_
biomass	_	_
by	_	_
primary	_	_
producers	_	_

Discussion	_	_

#360
The	_	_
model	_	_
we	_	_
present	_	_
here	_	_
is	_	_
very	_	_
simple	_	_
and	_	_
it	_	_
can	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
applied	_	_
to	_	_
understand	_	_
processes	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
plant	_	_
level	_	_
.	_	_

#361
Instead	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
seen	_	_
as	_	_
proof	_	_
of	_	_
concept	_	_
of	_	_
how	_	_
one	_	_
can	_	_
account	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
interactions	_	_
between	_	_
carbon	_	_
and	_	_
P	_	_
limitations	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
soil–vegetation	_	_
level	_	_
,	_	_
on	_	_
ecological	_	_
as	_	_
well	_	_
as	_	_
geological	_	_
timescales	_	_
.	_	_

#362
This	_	_
work	_	_
,	_	_
therefore	_	_
,	_	_
represents	_	_
a	_	_
first	_	_
step	_	_
towards	_	_
understanding	_	_
how	_	_
the	_	_
P	_	_
cycle	_	_
constrains	_	_
vegetation	_	_
and	_	_
how	_	_
vegetation	_	_
feedbacks	_	_
affect	_	_
P	_	_
dynamics	_	_
.	_	_

#363
With	_	_
this	_	_
simple	_	_
model	_	_
we	_	_
show	_	_
that	_	_
biomass	_	_
productivity	_	_
,	_	_
most	_	_
probably	_	_
,	_	_
depends	_	_
to	_	_
some	_	_
extent	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
feedback	_	_
processes	_	_
mediated	_	_
by	_	_
vegetation	_	_
and	_	_
,	_	_
more	_	_
importantly	_	_
,	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
long-term	_	_
P	_	_
cycle	_	_
.	_	_

#364
Hence	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
might	_	_
be	_	_
essential	_	_
to	_	_
consider	_	_
long-term	_	_
processes	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
P	_	_
cycle	_	_
and	_	_

#534
Our	_	_
results	_	_
strongly	_	_
suggest	_	_
that	_	_
P	_	_

of	_	_

can	_	_
be	_	_
an	_	_

of	_	_
terrestrial	_	_

#535
We	_	_

Although	_	_

this	_	_

:	_	_
weathering	_	_
,	_	_
de-occlusion	_	_

#538
Only	_	_
the	_	_

processes	_	_
were	_	_
evaluated	_	_

as	_	_
the	_	_

be	_	_

and	_	_
therefore	_	_
could	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
tested	_	_

#539
We	_	_
found	_	_
that	_	_
active	_	_
uptake	_	_
of	_	_
P	_	_

)	_	_
is	_	_
important	_	_

De-occlusion	_	_

The	_	_
inclusion	_	_
of	_	_
P	_	_
de-occlusion	_	_
mediated	_	_

resulted	_	_
in	_	_
unrealistically	_	_
low	_	_

in	_	_
,	_	_

this	_	_

not	_	_
correctly	_	_

that	_	_
this	_	_

does	_	_
not	_	_
alleviate	_	_

#542
The	_	_

spatial	_	_

#543
This	_	_
is	_	_
remarkable	_	_

the	_	_

amount	_	_

site-specific	_	_
information	_	_
fed	_	_
into	_	_
the	_	_

#544
Hence	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
presented	_	_
here	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
seen	_	_
as	_	_
