Broadly	_	_
speaking	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_

more	_	_
effective	_	_
at	_	_

leave	_	_

picture	_	_
obscure	_	_

These	_	_
limitations	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
preclude	_	_
the	_	_
possibility	_	_
posited	_	_

In	_	_
a	_	_
seminal	_	_
and	_	_
widely	_	_
cited	_	_
paper	_	_
,	_	_
Noy-Meir	_	_
(	_	_
1975	_	_
)	_	_
applied	_	_
predator-prey	_	_
theory	_	_
to	_	_
formulate	_	_
a	_	_
simple	_	_
model	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
dynamics	_	_
and	_	_
stability	_	_
of	_	_
continuously	_	_
grazed	_	_
systems	_	_
.	_	_

#19
The	_	_
two	_	_
basic	_	_
processes	_	_
that	_	_
determined	_	_
biomass	_	_
dynamics	_	_
were	_	_
plant	_	_
growth	_	_
and	_	_
animal	_	_
consumption	_	_
of	_	_
herbage	_	_
.	_	_

#20
Accordingly	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
comprised	_	_
one	_	_
function	_	_
that	_	_
described	_	_
herbage	_	_
growth	_	_
rate	_	_
and	_	_
another	_	_
that	_	_
described	_	_
herbage	_	_
consumption	_	_
rate	_	_
.	_	_

#21
The	_	_
model	_	_
was	_	_
applied	_	_
later	_	_
to	_	_
seasonal	_	_
pastures	_	_
(	_	_
Noy-Meir	_	_
,	_	_
1978a	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
differing	_	_
functional	_	_
forms	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
two	_	_
respective	_	_
core	_	_
functions	_	_
were	_	_
examined	_	_
(	_	_
Noy-Meir	_	_
,	_	_

)	_	_
