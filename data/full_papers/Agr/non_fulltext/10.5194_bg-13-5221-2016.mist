Long-term	_	_
drainage	_	_

considerable	_	_

After	_	_
20	_	_
years	_	_
of	_	_
rewetting	_	_
(	_	_
site	_	_
UG	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
emissions	_	_
of	_	_
CO2	_	_
and	_	_
N2O	_	_
were	_	_
significantly	_	_
lower	_	_
while	_	_
significantly	_	_
higher	_	_
amounts	_	_
of	_	_
CH4	_	_
were	_	_
emitted	_	_

Also	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
GWP	_	_
of	_	_
site	_	_
UG	_	_
was	_	_
significantly	_	_
reduced	_	_
.	_	_

#511
However	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
site	_	_
still	_	_
acted	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
C	_	_
source	_	_
and	_	_
showed	_	_
substantial	_	_
N2O	_	_
emissions	_	_
,	_	_
indicating	_	_
that	_	_
rewetting	_	_
had	_	_
not	_	_
yet	_	_
restored	_	_
the	_	_
natural	_	_
peatland	_	_
functioning	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
sink	_	_
for	_	_
C	_	_

a	_	_
negligible	_	_
source	_	_
for	_	_
N2O	_	_

Restoration	_	_
progress	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_

by	_	_
a	_	_
year-round	_	_
stabilization	_	_
of	_	_

In	_	_
the	_	_

state	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
mulching	_	_
of	_	_
vegetation	_	_
in	_	_

might	speculation	_
increase	_	_
total	_	_
annual	_	_

by	_	_
avoiding	_	_
early	_	_

and	_	_
thus	_	_
reduce	_	_

#514
Arable	_	_
forage	_	_
production	_	_
(	_	_

did	_	_
not	_	_
induce	_	_

to	_	_
intensive	_	_

only	_	_
showed	_	_
a	_	_
significantly	_	_

than	_	_
the	_	_

as	_	_
the	_	_

#515
However	_	_
,	_	_
interannual	_	_

#516
The	_	_
beginning	_	_
of	_	_
growing	_	_

was	_	_
identified	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
critical	_	_
period	_	_
,	_	_
with	_	_

occurring	_	_
with	_	_
an	_	_

period	_	_
.	_	_

#517
Yield-related	_	_
GHG	_	_
emissions	_	_
increased	_	_
with	_	_
increasing	_	_
drainage	_	_

in	_	_
the	_	_
order	_	_

between	_	_

#518
As	_	_
arable	_	_
cropping	_	_
was	_	_
associated	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
high	_	_
uncertainty	_	_
of	_	_
yield	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
high	_	_
GWP	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
type	_	_
of	_	_

identified	_	_
as	_	_

for	_	_

on	_	_

#519
The	_	_
wet	_	_
grassland	_	_
site	_	_
(	_	_
GW	_	_
)	_	_
realized	_	_
lowest	_	_
yield-related	_	_
emissions	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
significantly	_	_
lower	_	_

in	_	_

with	_	_
a	_	_
non-significantly	_	_

Thus	_	_

this	_	_

demonstrated	_	_
that	_	_
there	_	_
is	_	_
huge	_	_
potential	_	_
for	_	_

in	_	_
intensively	_	_
utilized	_	_
peatland	_	_
