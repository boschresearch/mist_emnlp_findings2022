This	_	_
approach	_	_
has	_	_
permitted	_	_
us	_	_
to	_	_
evaluate	_	_
climate	_	_
change	_	_
impacts	_	_
in	_	_

The	_	_
methodology	_	_
,	_	_
although	_	_
introducing	_	_
additional	_	_
uncertainty	_	_
,	_	_
has	_	_
allowed	_	_

the	_	_
risk	_	_
of	_	_
crop	_	_

climate	_	_
change	_	_
by	_	_
assigning	_	_
probability	_	_

of	_	_
the	_	_
impact	_	_
instead	_	_
of	_	_
providing	_	_
only	_	_

warmer	_	_

drier	_	_
climate	_	_
over	_	_
the	_	_

will	_	_
increase	_	_
the	_	_

the	_	_
