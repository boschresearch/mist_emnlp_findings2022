#29
Future	_	_
climate	_	_
and	_	_
land	_	_
use	_	_
changes	_	_
might	_	_
substantially	_	_
modify	_	_
the	_	_
hydrological	_	_
processes	_	_
and	_	_
consequently	_	_
,	_	_
having	_	_

#30
While	_	_
climate	_	_
change	_	_
will	_	_
alter	_	_
hydrological	_	_
conditions	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
major	_	_
climate	_	_
variables	_	_
(	_	_
air	_	_
temperature	_	_
,	_	_
precipitation	_	_
and	_	_
evapotranspiration	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
groundwater	_	_
resources	_	_
will	_	_
be	_	_
impacted	_	_
by	_	_
climate	_	_
change	_	_
not	_	_
only	_	_
through	_	_
their	_	_
interaction	_	_
with	_	_
surface	_	_

(	_	_
e.g.	_	_

,	_	_
but	_	_
also	_	_
,	_	_
indirectly	_	_
,	_	_
through	_	_
the	_	_

#31
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
quantifying	_	_
climate	_	_
change	_	_
impacts	_	_
on	_	_

requires	_	_
assessment	_	_

of	_	_
the	_	_

that	_	_

However	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
proper	_	_
assessment	_	_
of	_	_
those	_	_
