#291
In	_	_
this	_	_
study	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
investigate	_	_
the	_	_
impact	_	_
of	_	_

the	_	_

in	_	_
a	_	_
commercial	_	_

#292
We	_	_
found	_	_
that	_	_
drought	_	_
and	_	_
smoke	_	_

conditions	_	_
,	_	_
with	_	_

temperature	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_

are	_	_
major	_	_
disturbing	_	_
factors	_	_
for	_	_
oil	_	_
palm	_	_
plantations	_	_
.	_	_

#293
Our	_	_
measurements	_	_
and	_	_
MLRM	_	_
showed	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
strong	_	_
haze	_	_
amplified	_	_
the	_	_
negative	_	_
effects	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
drought	_	_
.	_	_

#294
It	_	_
is	_	_
very	_	_
likely	_	_
that	_	_
without	_	_
the	_	_
haze	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
negative	_	_

on	_	_
CO2	_	_

carbon	_	_

have	_	_
been	_	_

Although	_	_
