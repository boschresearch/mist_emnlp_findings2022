ABSTRACT	_	_
Plants	_	_
are	_	_
typically	_	_
infected	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
consortium	_	_
of	_	_
internal	_	_
fungal	_	_
associates	_	_
,	_	_
including	_	_
endophytes	_	_
in	_	_
their	_	_
leaves	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
well	_	_
as	_	_
arbuscular	_	_
mycorrhizal	_	_
fungi	_	_
(	_	_
AMF	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
dark	_	_
septate	_	_
endophytes	_	_
(	_	_
DSE	_	_
)	_	_
in	_	_
their	_	_
roots	_	_

It	_	_
is	_	_
logical	_	_
that	_	_
these	_	_
organisms	_	_
will	_	_
interact	_	_
with	_	_
each	_	_
other	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
abiotic	_	_
environment	_	_
in	_	_
addition	_	_
to	_	_
their	_	_
host	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
there	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
little	_	_
work	_	_
to	_	_
date	_	_
examining	_	_
the	_	_
interactions	_	_
of	_	_
multiple	_	_
symbionts	_	_
within	_	_
single	_	_
plant	_	_
hosts	_	_
,	_	_
or	_	_
how	_	_
the	_	_
relationships	_	_
among	_	_
symbionts	_	_
and	_	_
their	_	_
host	_	_
change	_	_
across	_	_
environmental	_	_
conditions	_	_
.	_	_

We	_	_
examined	_	_
the	_	_
grass	_	_
Agrostis	_	_

#3
Each	_	_
plant	_	_
was	_	_
tested	_	_
for	_	_
presence	_	_
of	_	_
foliar	_	_
endophytes	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
genus	_	_
Epichlo¨e	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
we	_	_
measured	_	_
percent	_	_
root	_	_

(	_	_
PRLC	_	_
)	_	_
by	_	_
AMF	_	_
and	_	_
DSE	_	_
.	_	_

#4
We	_	_
hypothesized	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
symbionts	_	_
in	_	_
our	_	_
system	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
in	_	_
competition	_	_
for	_	_
host	_	_
resources	_	_
,	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
outcome	_	_
of	_	_
that	_	_
competition	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_
driven	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
benefit	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
host	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
host	_	_
plants	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
allocate	_	_
carbon	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
symbionts	_	_
in	_	_
such	_	_
a	_	_
way	_	_
as	_	_
to	_	_
maximize	_	_
fitness	_	_
benefit	_	_
within	_	_
a	_	_
particular	_	_
environmental	_	_
context	_	_
.	_	_

#5
We	_	_
found	_	_
a	_	_
correlation	_	_
between	_	_
DSE	_	_
and	_	_
AMF	_	_
PRLC	_	_
across	_	_
climatic	_	_
conditions	_	_
;	_	_
we	_	_
also	_	_
found	_	_
a	_	_
fitness	_	_
cost	_	_
to	_	_
increasing	_	_
DSE	_	_
colonization	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
was	_	_
negated	_	_
by	_	_
presence	_	_
of	_	_
Epichlo¨e	_	_
endophytes	_	_
.	_	_

#6
These	_	_
results	_	_
suggest	_	_
that	_	_
selective	_	_
pressure	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
host	_	_
is	_	_
likely	_	_
to	_	_
favor	_	_
host/symbiont	_	_
relationships	_	_

most	_	_
beneficial	_	_
way	_	_
possible	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
host	_	_

not	_	_
necessarily	_	_
favoring	_	_
the	_	_
individual	_	_
symbiont	_	_
