INTRODUCTION	_	_
Ensiling	_	_
is	_	_
complex	_	_
process	_	_
that	_	_
involves	_	_
the	_	_
interaction	_	_
among	_	_
plant	_	_
enzymes	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
action	_	_
of	_	_
numerous	_	_
microbial	_	_
species	_	_
,	_	_
ultimately	_	_
changing	_	_
the	_	_
biochemistry	_	_
of	_	_

Particular	_	_
emphasis	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
made	_	_
in	_	_
studies	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
reactions	_	_

in	_	_

the	_	_

did	_	_
not	_	_
receive	_	_
the	_	_

interest	_	_

#13
Some	_	_
studies	_	_
demonstrate	_	_
that	_	_
starch	_	_
and	_	_
hemicellulose	_	_
degradation	_	_
do	_	_
take	_	_
place	_	_
during	_	_
ensiling	_	_
as	_	_
their	_	_
levels	_	_
in	_	_
pre-ensiled	_	_
are	_	_
higher	_	_
than	_	_
those	_	_
after	_	_
ensiling	_	_

Furthermore	_	_

previous	_	_
researches	_	_

indicate	_	_
that	_	_
they	_	_
