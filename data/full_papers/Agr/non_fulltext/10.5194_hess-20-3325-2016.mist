#298
Planting	_	_

#299
However	_	_
,	_	_

#300
There	_	_
were	_	_

in	_	_

relative	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_

#301
This	_	_
shows	_	_
that	_	_
planting	_	_
switchgrass	_	_
alone	_	_
may	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
sufficient	_	_
to	_	_

#302
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
our	_	_
results	_	_
indicate	_	_
that	_	_
substantially	_	_
improving	_	_
water	_	_
quality	_	_
will	_	_
require	_	_
a	_	_
combination	_	_
of	_	_
working	_	_
land	_	_
practices	_	_
(	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
conservation	_	_

and	_	_

such	_	_

such	_	_
as	_	_
switchgrass	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#303
This	_	_
will	_	_
in	_	_
turn	_	_
necessitate	_	_
substantive	_	_
conservation	_	_
efforts	_	_
,	_	_
higher	_	_
than	_	_
historical	_	_
levels	_	_
.	_	_

#304
Unfortunately	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
latest	_	_
farm	_	_
bill	_	_
has	_	_
both	_	_
reduced	_	_
overall	_	_
conservation	_	_
funding	_	_
by	_	_
almost	_	_
EUR	_	_
4	_	_
billion	_	_
over	_	_
a	_	_
10	_	_
year	_	_
span	_	_
and	_	_
reduced	_	_
the	_	_
proportion	_	_

(	_	_

#305
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
increased	_	_
conservation	_	_
will	_	_
only	_	_
occur	_	_
via	_	_
