that	_	_
a	_	_

creating	_	_

women’s	_	_
livelihood	_	_
assets	_	_
are	_	_
being	_	_
undermined	_	_
by	_	_
climate	_	_

,	_	_
such	_	_

a	_	_
key	_	_
concern	_	_

#38
Ultimately	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
use	_	_
the	_	_
example	_	_
of	_	_

experiences	_	_
with	_	_

to	_	_
demonstrate	_	_
the	_	_

#68
In	_	_
our	_	_
view	_	_

capacity	_	_
building	_	_

Ultimately	_	_

analyze	_	_
not	_	_
only	_	_
vulnerabilities	_	_
obviously	_	_
shaped	_	_

In	_	_

we	_	_
believe	_	_
