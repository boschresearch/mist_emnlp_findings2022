ABSTRACT	_	_
Background	_	_
:	_	_
The	_	_
Qinghai-Tibet	_	_
Plateau	_	_
(	_	_
QTP	_	_
)	_	_
is	_	_
home	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
vast	_	_
grassland	_	_
in	_	_
China	_	_
.	_	_

#1
The	_	_
QTP	_	_
grassland	_	_
ecosystem	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
seriously	_	_
degraded	_	_
by	_	_
human	_	_
land	_	_
use	_	_
practices	_	_
and	_	_
climate	_	_
change	_	_
.	_	_

#2
Fertilization	_	_
is	_	_
used	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
region	_	_
to	_	_
increase	_	_
vegetation	_	_
yields	_	_
for	_	_
grazers	_	_
.	_	_

#3
The	_	_
impact	_	_
of	_	_
long-term	_	_
fertilization	_	_
on	_	_
plant	_	_
and	_	_
microbial	_	_
communities	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
studied	_	_
extensively	_	_
.	_	_

#4
However	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
influence	_	_
of	_	_
short-term	_	_
fertilization	_	_
on	_	_
arbuscular	_	_
mycorrhizal	_	_
fungal	_	_
(	_	_
AMF	_	_
)	_	_
communities	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
QTP	_	_
is	_	_
largely	_	_
unknown	_	_
,	_	_
despite	_	_
their	_	_
important	_	_
functional	_	_
role	_	_
in	_	_
grassland	_	_
ecosystems	_	_
.	_	_

#5
Methods	_	_
:	_	_
We	_	_
investigated	_	_
AMF	_	_
community	_	_
responses	_	_
to	_	_
three	_	_
years	_	_
of	_	_
N	_	_
and/or	_	_
P	_	_
addition	_	_
at	_	_
an	_	_
experimental	_	_
field	_	_
site	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
QTP	_	_
,	_	_
using	_	_
the	_	_
Illumina	_	_
MiSeq	_	_
platform	_	_
(	_	_
PE	_	_
300	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#6
Results	_	_
:	_	_
Fertilization	_	_
resulted	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
dramatic	_	_
shift	_	_
in	_	_
AMF	_	_
community	_	_
composition	_	_
and	_	_
NP	_	_
addition	_	_
significantly	_	_
increased	_	_
AMF	_	_
species	_	_
richness	_	_
and	_	_
phylogenetic	_	_
diversity	_	_
.	_	_

#7
Aboveground	_	_
biomass	_	_
,	_	_
available	_	_
phosphorus	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
NO3	_	_
significantly	_	_
correlated	_	_
with	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_
AMF	_	_
community	_	_
structure	_	_
.	_	_

#8
Changes	_	_
in	_	_
these	_	_
factors	_	_
were	_	_
driven	_	_
by	_	_
fertilization	_	_
treatments	_	_
.	_	_

#9
Thus	_	_
,	_	_
fertilization	_	_
had	_	_
a	_	_
large	_	_
impact	_	_
on	_	_
AMF	_	_
communities	_	_
,	_	_
mediated	_	_
by	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_
aboveground	_	_
productivity	_	_
and	_	_
soil	_	_
chemistry	_	_
.	_	_

#10
Discussion	_	_
:	_	_
Prior	_	_
work	_	_
has	_	_
shown	_	_
how	_	_
plants	_	_
often	_	_
lower	_	_
their	_	_
reliance	_	_
on	_	_
AMF	_	_
symbioses	_	_
following	_	_
fertilization	_	_
,	_	_
leading	_	_
to	_	_
decrease	_	_
AMF	_	_
abundance	_	_
and	_	_
diversity	_	_
.	_	_

#11
However	_	_
,	_	_
our	_	_
study	_	_
reports	_	_
a	_	_
rise	_	_
in	_	_
AMF	_	_
diversity	_	_
with	_	_
fertilization	_	_
treatment	_	_
.	_	_

#12
Because	_	_
AMF	_	_
can	_	_
provide	_	_
stress	_	_
tolerance	_	_
to	_	_
their	_	_
hosts	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
suggest	_	_
that	_	_
extreme	_	_
weather	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
QTP	_	_
may	_	_
help	_	_
drive	_	_
a	_	_
positive	_	_
relationship	_	_
between	_	_
fertilizer	_	_
amendment	_	_
and	_	_
AMF	_	_
diversity	_	_

In	_	_

our	_	_

that	_	_

the	_	_

is	_	_
the	_	_
