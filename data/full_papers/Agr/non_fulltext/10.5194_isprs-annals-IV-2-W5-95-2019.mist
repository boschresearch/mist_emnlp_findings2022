To	_	_

It	_	_

this	_	_

CONCLUSION	_	_
In	_	_
this	_	_
paper	_	_
we	_	_
presented	_	_
a	_	_
pipeline	_	_
on	_	_
deriving	_	_
wheat	_	_
crop	_	_
heights	_	_
from	_	_
multi	_	_
temporal	_	_

taken	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
UAV	_	_
.	_	_

#264
In	_	_
contrast	_	_
to	_	_
previous	_	_
publications	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
started	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
dense	_	_
point	_	_
clouds	_	_
,	_	_
generated	_	_
from	_	_
SfM	_	_
and	_	_
MVS	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
focussed	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
comparison	_	_
of	_	_
different	_	_
processing	_	_
options	_	_
within	_	_
this	_	_
pipeline	_	_
.	_	_

#265
The	_	_
goal	_	_
was	_	_
to	_	_
select	_	_
a	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_
options	_	_
and	_	_
parameters	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
allow	_	_
an	_	_
automatic	_	_
extraction	_	_
of	_	_
crop	_	_
height	_	_
curves	_	_
from	_	_
areas	_	_
of	_	_
interests	_	_
,	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
plots	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
breeding	_	_
experiment	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
an	_	_
efficient	_	_
way	_	_
.	_	_

#266
We	_	_
showed	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
calculation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
crop	_	_
height	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
difference	_	_
between	_	_
crop	_	_
surface	_	_
and	_	_
some	_	_
reference	_	_
surface	_	_
,	_	_
representing	_	_
the	_	_
soil	_	_
(	_	_
height	_	_
=	_	_
0	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
efficiently	_	_
realized	_	_
by	_	_
subtracting	_	_
two	_	_
rasters	_	_
(	_	_
‘elevation	_	_
models’	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#267
The	_	_
result	_	_
is	_	_
very	_	_
similar	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
computational	_	_
more	_	_
