The	_	_

At	_	_
the	_	_

a	_	_

that	_	_
allows	_	_

We	_	_

#467
We	_	_
have	_	_
done	_	_
extensive	_	_
performance	_	_
analysis	_	_
of	_	_
CafRep	_	_
in	_	_
three	_	_

We	_	_
show	_	_
that	_	_
CafRep	_	_
outperforms	_	_
five	_	_

#469
We	_	_
also	_	_
show	_	_
that	_	_
CafRep	_	_
maintains	_	_
performance	_	_

in	_	_
two	_	_
application	_	_

#470
We	_	_
believe	_	_
that	_	_
CafRep	_	_
provides	_	_
a	_	_
useful	_	_
generic	_	_
and	_	_
highly	_	_
adaptive	_	_
congestion	_	_

#471
We	_	_
also	_	_
plan	_	_
to	_	_
investigate	_	_
the	_	_
efficiency	_	_
of	_	_
CafRep	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
