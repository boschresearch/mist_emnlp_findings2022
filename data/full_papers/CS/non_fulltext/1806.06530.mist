Currently	_	_

which	_	_
is	_	_
time-consuming	_	_

Automated	_	_

The	_	_

An	_	_

In	_	_

the	_	_

Thus	_	_

the	_	_
geometric	_	_

#40
This	_	_
distinguishes	_	_
the	_	_

from	_	_
acquisitions	_	_

the	_	_

the	_	_

may	_	_
be	_	_
strong	_	_
enough	_	_

careful	_	_

#41
However	_	_

also	_	_
makes	_	_
it	_	_
more	_	_

Therefore	_	_

#146
The	_	_

we	_	_
reduce	_	_

to	_	_
a	_	_
single	_	_
radial	_	_

assume	_	_
both	_	_

the	_	_

to	_	_
be	_	_
located	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
image	_	_

#522
During	_	_
optimization	_	_
,	_	_
these	_	_
two	_	_

are	_	_
kept	_	_
constant	_	_
.	_	_

#523
In	_	_
this	_	_
experiment	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
also	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
correct	_	_
the	_	_
curve	_	_
grid	_	_
using	_	_
affine	_	_
MLS	_	_
.	_	_

#524
The	_	_
comparison	_	_
against	_	_
PGA	_	_
shows	_	_
that	_	_
such	_	_
a	_	_
simplistic	_	_
lens	_	_
model	_	_
is	_	_
still	_	_
more	_	_

both	_	_
in	_	_

,	_	_
while	_	_
the	_	_

the	_	_

considerably	_	_

Table	_	_

)	_	_
.	_	_

#526
The	_	_
reason	_	_
for	_	_
this	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
such	_	_
a	_	_
lens	_	_
parametrization	_	_
is	_	_
too	_	_
rigid	_	_
.	_	_

#527
As	_	_
a	_	_
consequence	_	_

this	_	_
weakens	_	_
the	_	_
grid	_	_
detection	_	_
:	_	_
correctly	_	_
detected	_	_
curves	_	_
are	_	_
erroneously	_	_

only	_	_

.	_	_

#528
For	_	_
the	_	_
next	_	_

we	_	_
increase	_	_
the	_	_
number	_	_

#529
Both	_	_

Mounts	_	_

cause	_	_

.	_	_

#585
Early	_	_
stages	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_

focus	_	_
on	_	_
ridges	_	_
without	_	_
analyzing	_	_
the	_	_

which	_	_
may	_	_
occasionally	_	_
lead	_	_
to	_	_
spurious	_	_
edges	_	_
and	_	_
eventually	_	_
to	_	_
an	_	_
incorrect	_	_
segmentation	_	_

#586
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
automatic	_	_
image	_	_
cropping	_	_
prior	_	_
to	_	_
PV	_	_
module	_	_

could	_	_
help	_	_
reduce	_	_
segmentation	_	_
failures	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
visible	_	_

.	_	_

#587
While	_	_
the	_	_
algorithm	_	_
is	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
process	_	_
disconnected	_	_
(	_	_
dark	_	_
)	_	_
cells	_	_
,	_	_
rows	_	_

columns	_	_
with	_	_
more	_	_
than	_	_
50	_	_
%	_	_

cells	_	_
pose	_	_
a	_	_
difficulty	_	_
in	_	_
correctly	_	_
detecting	_	_
the	_	_
grid	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
insufficient	_	_
edge	_	_
information	_	_

#588
However	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
observed	_	_
that	_	_
also	_	_
human	_	_
experts	_	_
have	_	_
problems	_	_
to	_	_
determine	_	_
the	_	_
contours	_	_
under	_	_
such	_	_
circumstances	_	_
.	_	_

#589
We	_	_
also	_	_
observed	_	_
that	_	_
smooth	_	_
edges	_	_
can	_	_
result	_	_
in	_	_
segmentation	_	_
failures	_	_
.	_	_

#590
This	_	_
is	_	_
because	_	_
the	_	_
stickness	_	_
of	_	_
smooth	_	_
edges	_	_
is	_	_
weak	_	_
and	_	_
may	_	_
completely	_	_
fade	_	_
away	_	_
after	_	_
non-maximum	_	_
suppression	_	_
.	_	_

#591
This	_	_
problem	_	_
is	_	_
also	_	_
related	_	_
to	_	_
situations	_	_
where	_	_
the	_	_
inter-cell	_	_

are	_	_
exceptionally	_	_
wide	_	_
.	_	_

#592
In	_	_
such	_	_
cases	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
necessary	_	_
to	_	_
adjust	_	_
the	_	_
parameters	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
ridgeness	_	_

Conclusions	_	_

#594
In	_	_
this	_	_
work	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
presented	_	_
a	_	_
fully	_	_
automatic	_	_
segmentation	_	_
method	_	_
for	_	_
precise	_	_
extraction	_	_
of	_	_
solar	_	_
cells	_	_
from	_	_
high	_	_
resolution	_	_
EL	_	_
images	_	_
.	_	_

#595
The	_	_
proposed	_	_
segmentation	_	_
is	_	_
robust	_	_
to	_	_
underexposure	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
works	_	_
robustly	_	_
in	_	_
presence	_	_
of	_	_
severe	_	_
defects	_	_
on	_	_
solar	_	_
cells	_	_
.	_	_

#596
This	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
attributed	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
preprocessing	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
ridgeness	_	_
filtering	_	_
,	_	_
coupled	_	_
with	_	_
tensor	_	_
voting	_	_
to	_	_
robustly	_	_
determine	_	_
the	_	_
inter-cell	_	_
borders	_	_
and	_	_
busbars	_	_
.	_	_

#597
The	_	_
segmentation	_	_
is	_	_
highly	_	_
accurate	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
allows	_	_
to	_	_
use	_	_
its	_	_
output	_	_
for	_	_
further	_	_
inspection	_	_
tasks	_	_
,	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
automatic	_	_
classification	_	_
of	_	_
defective	_	_
solar	_	_
cells	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
prediction	_	_
of	_	_
power	_	_
loss	_	_
.	_	_

#598
We	_	_
evaluated	_	_
the	_	_
segmentation	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
Jaccard	_	_
index	_	_
on	_	_
eight	_	_
different	_	_
PV	_	_
modules	_	_
consisting	_	_
of	_	_
408	_	_
hand-labeled	_	_
solar	_	_
cells	_	_
.	_	_

#599
The	_	_
proposed	_	_
approach	_	_
is	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
segment	_	_
solar	_	_
cells	_	_
with	_	_
an	_	_
accuracy	_	_
of	_	_
97.80	_	_
%	_	_
.	_	_

#600
With	_	_
respect	_	_
to	_	_
classification	_	_
performance	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
segmentation	_	_
pipeline	_	_
reaches	_	_
an	_	_
F1	_	_
score	_	_
of	_	_
97.62	_	_
%	_	_
.	_	_

#601
Additionally	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
compared	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
method	_	_
against	_	_
the	_	_
PV	_	_
module	_	_
detection	_	_
approach	_	_
by	_	_
Sovetkin	_	_
and	_	_
Steland	_	_
[	_	_

]	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
is	_	_
slightly	_	_
more	_	_
robust	_	_
but	_	_
less	_	_
accurate	_	_
than	_	_
our	_	_
method	_	_
.	_	_

#602
The	_	_
comparison	_	_
also	_	_
shows	_	_
that	_	_
our	_	_
joint	_	_
lens	_	_
distortion	_	_
estimation	_	_
and	_	_
grid	_	_
detection	_	_
approach	_	_
achieves	_	_
a	_	_
higher	_	_
accuracy	_	_
than	_	_
a	_	_
method	_	_
that	_	_
decouples	_	_
both	_	_
steps	_	_
.	_	_

#603
Beyond	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
applications	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
method	_	_
can	_	_
serve	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
starting	_	_
point	_	_
for	_	_
bootstrapping	_	_
deep	_	_
learning	_	_
architectures	_	_
that	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_

end-to-end	_	_

directly	_	_
segment	_	_
the	_	_
solar	_	_
