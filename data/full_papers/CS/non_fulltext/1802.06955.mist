CONCLUSION	_	_
AND	_	_
FUTURE	_	_
WORKS	_	_
In	_	_
this	_	_
paper	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
proposed	_	_
an	_	_
extension	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
U-Net	_	_
architecture	_	_
using	_	_
Recurrent	_	_
Convolutional	_	_
Neural	_	_
Networks	_	_
and	_	_
Recurrent	_	_
Residual	_	_
Convolutional	_	_
Neural	_	_
Networks	_	_
.	_	_

#327
The	_	_
proposed	_	_
models	_	_
are	_	_
called	_	_
“RU-Net”	_	_
and	_	_
“R2U-Net”	_	_
respectively	_	_
.	_	_

#328
These	_	_
models	_	_
were	_	_
evaluated	_	_
using	_	_
three	_	_
different	_	_
applications	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
field	_	_
of	_	_
medical	_	_
imaging	_	_
including	_	_
retina	_	_
blood	_	_
vessel	_	_
segmentation	_	_
,	_	_
skin	_	_
cancer	_	_
lesion	_	_
segmentation	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
lung	_	_
segmentation	_	_
.	_	_

#329
The	_	_
experimental	_	_
results	_	_
demonstrate	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
RU-Net	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
R2U-Net	_	_
models	_	_
show	_	_
better	_	_
performance	_	_
in	_	_
segmentation	_	_
tasks	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_
network	_	_
parameters	_	_
when	_	_
compared	_	_
to	_	_
existing	_	_
methods	_	_
including	_	_
the	_	_
U-Net	_	_
and	_	_
residual	_	_
U-Net	_	_
(	_	_
or	_	_
ResU-Net	_	_
)	_	_
models	_	_
on	_	_
all	_	_
three	_	_
datasets	_	_
.	_	_

#330
In	_	_
addition	_	_
,	_	_
results	_	_
show	_	_
that	_	_
these	_	_
proposed	_	_
models	_	_
not	_	_
only	_	_
ensure	_	_
better	_	_
performance	_	_
during	_	_
the	_	_
training	_	_
but	_	_
also	_	_
in	_	_
testing	_	_
phase	_	_
.	_	_

#331
In	_	_
future	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
would	_	_
like	_	_
to	_	_
explore	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
architecture	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
novel	_	_
feature	_	_
fusion	_	_
strategy	_	_

encoding	_	_
to	_	_

decoding	_	_
units	_	_
