In	_	_
this	_	_

we	_	_
present	_	_
a	_	_
novel	_	_
approach	_	_
for	_	_

#1
Using	_	_
the	_	_
attention	_	_
maps	_	_
produced	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
Teacher-	_	_
Network	_	_
we	_	_
are	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
improve	_	_
the	_	_
quality	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
generated	_	_
images	_	_
as	_	_
well	_	_
as	_	_
perform	_	_
weakly	_	_
object	_	_
localization	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
generated	_	_
images	_	_
.	_	_

#2
To	_	_
this	_	_
end	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
generate	_	_
images	_	_
of	_	_
HEp-2	_	_
cells	_	_
captured	_	_
with	_	_
Indirect	_	_
Imunofluoresence	_	_
(	_	_
IIF	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
study	_	_
the	_	_
ability	_	_
of	_	_
our	_	_
network	_	_
to	_	_
perform	_	_
a	_	_
weakly	_	_
localization	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
cell	_	_
.	_	_

#3
Firstly	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
demonstrate	_	_
that	_	_
whilst	_	_
GANs	_	_
can	_	_
learn	_	_
the	_	_
mapping	_	_
between	_	_
the	_	_
input	_	_
domain	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
target	_	_
distribution	_	_
efficiently	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
discriminator	_	_
network	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
detect	_	_
the	_	_
regions	_	_
of	_	_
interest	_	_
.	_	_

#4
Secondly	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
present	_	_
a	_	_
novel	_	_
attention	_	_
transfer	_	_
mechanism	_	_
which	_	_
allows	_	_
us	_	_
to	_	_
enforce	_	_
the	_	_
discriminator	_	_
to	_	_
put	_	_
emphasis	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
regions	_	_
of	_	_
interest	_	_
via	_	_
transfer	_	_
learning	_	_
.	_	_

#5
Thirdly	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
show	_	_
that	_	_
this	_	_
leads	_	_
to	_	_
more	_	_
realistic	_	_
images	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
discriminator	_	_
learns	_	_
to	_	_
put	_	_
emphasis	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
area	_	_
of	_	_
interest	_	_
.	_	_

#6
Fourthly	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
method	_	_
allows	_	_
one	_	_
to	_	_
generate	_	_
both	_	_
images	_	_
as	_	_
well	_	_
as	_	_
attention	_	_
maps	_	_
which	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
useful	_	_
for	_	_
data	_	_
annotation	_	_
e.g	_	_
in	_	_

INTRODUCTION	_	_
Over	_	_
the	_	_

a	_	_
radically	_	_
new	_	_
approach	_	_
for	_	_
training	_	_
a	_	_
generative	_	_
model	_	_

#10
This	_	_
formulation	_	_
allows	_	_
one	_	_
to	_	_
capture	_	_
high	_	_
dimensional	_	_
and	_	_
complex	_	_
distributions	_	_
efficiently	_	_
using	_	_
a	_	_
minmax	_	_
game	_	_
between	_	_
two	_	_
Neural	_	_
Networks	_	_
-	_	_
one	_	_
that	_	_
generates	_	_
samples	_	_
and	_	_
one	_	_
that	_	_
evaluates	_	_
them	_	_
as	_	_
real	_	_
or	_	_
fake	_	_
.	_	_

#11
In	_	_
this	_	_
game	_	_
and	_	_
for	_	_
image	_	_
data	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
generator	_	_
learns	_	_
the	_	_
mapping	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
low	_	_
dimensional	_	_
space	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
space	_	_
of	_	_
images	_	_
,	_	_
allowing	_	_
one	_	_
to	_	_
sample	_	_
images	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
high-dimensional	_	_
distribution	_	_
by	_	_
sampling	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
lower-dimensional	_	_
distribution	_	_
.	_	_

#12
These	_	_
models	_	_
have	_	_
been	_	_
applied	_	_
in	_	_
many	_	_
computer	_	_
vision	_	_
tasks	_	_
like	_	_

#13
Furthermore	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
tasks	_	_
where	_	_
data	_	_
are	_	_
limited	_	_
(	_	_
e.g.	_	_

)	_	_
it	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
used	_	_
for	_	_

#14
One	_	_
major	_	_
limitation	_	_
of	_	_
current	_	_
deep	_	_
neural	_	_
network	_	_
models	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
lack	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
mechanism	_	_
for	_	_
knowledge	_	_
transfer	_	_
between	_	_

Transfer	_	_
learning	_	_
aims	_	_
to	_	_
address	_	_
this	_	_
limitation	_	_
by	_	_
suggesting	_	_
novel	_	_
ways	_	_
for	_	_

the	_	_

#16
However	_	_
,	_	_
these	_	_
works	_	_
focus	_	_
on	_	_
transferring	_	_
the	_	_
knowledge	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_

with	_	_
respect	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_

#36
In	_	_
this	_	_

a	_	_

us	_	_
to	_	_
transfer	_	_
the	_	_

#37
To	_	_
achieve	_	_
this	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
reformulate	_	_
the	_	_
method	_	_
of	_	_
CAMs	_	_
[	_	_
10	_	_
]	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
way	_	_

us	_	_
to	_	_
incorporate	_	_
the	_	_
soft	_	_
responses	_	_
of	_	_
all	_	_
classes	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
estimation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
CAM	_	_
image	_	_
.	_	_

#38
Our	_	_
intuition	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
there	_	_
are	_	_
some	_	_
common	_	_
features	_	_
shared	_	_
across	_	_
HEp-2	_	_
cell	_	_
image	_	_
categories	_	_
located	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
area	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
hence	_	_
,	_	_
incorporating	_	_
them	_	_
according	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
Soft-Max	_	_
response	_	_
allows	_	_
us	_	_
to	_	_
proportionally	_	_
consider	_	_
patterns	_	_
from	_	_
all	_	_
categories	_	_
.	_	_

#39
The	_	_
proposed	_	_
method	_	_
is	_	_
named	_	_
as	_	_
Soft-CAMS	_	_
(	_	_
SCAMS	_	_
)	_	_

#40
The	_	_
Soft-CAMs	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
are	_	_
presented	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

will	_	_
be	_	_
used	_	_
to	_	_

the	_	_

better	_	_

we	_	_
