However	_	_

these	_	_

have	_	_
focused	_	_
exclusively	_	_

are	_	_
just	_	_
tens	_	_

in	_	_

Consequently	_	_

Introduction	_	_

#13
Visual	_	_
object	_	_
tracking	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
task	_	_
of	_	_
locating	_	_
an	_	_
arbitrary	_	_
,	_	_
user-specified	_	_
target	_	_
in	_	_
all	_	_
frames	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
video	_	_
sequence	_	_
.	_	_

#14
Traditionally	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
target	_	_
is	_	_
specified	_	_
using	_	_
a	_	_
rectangle	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
single	_	_
frame	_	_
.	_	_

#15
The	_	_
ability	_	_
to	_	_
track	_	_
an	_	_
arbitrary	_	_
object	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
useful	_	_
for	_	_
many	_	_
applications	_	_

However	_	_

the	_	_

able	_	_
to	_	_
track	_	_
anything	_	_
given	_	_
only	_	_
a	_	_
single	_	_
example	_	_
presents	_	_
a	_	_
significant	_	_
challenge	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
many	_	_
complex	_	_
factors	_	_
that	_	_

Despite	_	_

the	_	_

Several	_	_

required	_	_

#85
The	_	_
major	_	_
issue	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
tracklet	_	_
duration	_	_
is	_	_
limited	_	_
to	_	_
less	_	_
than	_	_
20	_	_

#86
However	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
often	_	_
occurs	_	_
that	_	_
multiple	_	_

in	_	_
one	_	_
video	_	_
refer	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
object	_	_
instance	_	_
.	_	_

#87
We	_	_
identify	_	_
these	_	_
tracklets	_	_
and	_	_
combine	_	_
their	_	_
annotations	_	_
in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
obtain	_	_
significantly	_	_
longer	_	_
sequences	_	_
,	_	_
albeit	_	_
with	_	_
large	_	_
gaps	_	_
between	_	_

#88
This	_	_
process	_	_
involves	_	_
finding	_	_
the	_	_
videos	_	_

contain	_	_
multiple	_	_

the	_	_

refer	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_

.	_	_

#89
Another	_	_
issue	_	_
with	_	_
YTBB	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
frame	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
track	_	_
may	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
a	_	_
suitable	_	_
initial	_	_
example	_	_
to	_	_
specify	_	_
the	_	_
target	_	_

#90
To	_	_
remedy	_	_
this	_	_
issue	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
each	_	_
video	_	_
we	_	_
manually	_	_
select	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
annotated	_	_
frame	_	_
in	_	_
which	_	_
the	_	_
bounding	_	_
box	_	_
alone	_	_
provides	_	_
a	_	_
clear	_	_
and	_	_
sufficient	_	_
definition	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
target	_	_
.	_	_

#91
All	_	_
annotations	_	_
preceding	_	_
this	_	_
frame	_	_
are	_	_
discarded	_	_
.	_	_

#92
The	_	_
final	_	_
manual	_	_
stage	_	_
is	_	_
to	_	_
exclude	_	_
sequences	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
of	_	_
little	_	_
interest	_	_
for	_	_
tracking	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
example	_	_
those	_	_
in	_	_
which	_	_
the	_	_
target	_	_
object	_	_
undergoes	_	_
little	_	_
motion	_	_
or	_	_
fills	_	_

This	_	_

the	_	_
question	_	_

evaluate	_	_

ability	_	_
both	_	_

#150
With	_	_
this	_	_
intention	_	_

we	_	_
introduce	_	_
an	_	_

#151
Let	_	_
us	_	_
equate	_	_

In	_	_
a	_	_

In	_	_
a	_	_

#155
Using	_	_
these	_	_

#156
However	_	_
,	_	_
some	_	_
performance	_	_
measures	_	_
are	_	_
inappropriate	_	_
because	_	_
the	_	_
dataset	_	_
possesses	_	_
a	_	_
severe	_	_
class	_	_

:	_	_
although	_	_

a	_	_

introduced	_	_
the	_	_
OxUvA	_	_
long-term	_	_

with	_	_
which	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
possible	_	_
to	_	_
assess	_	_
methods	_	_
on	_	_
sequences	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
minutes	_	_
in	_	_

and	_	_
often	_	_
contain	_	_
disappearance	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
target	_	_
object	_	_

#317
Our	_	_
benchmark	_	_

the	_	_

proposed	_	_
in	_	_

To	_	_
justify	_	_
this	_	_
decision	_	_

we	_	_
empirically	_	_
show	_	_
that	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
sake	_	_
of	_	_
reliability	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
high	_	_
