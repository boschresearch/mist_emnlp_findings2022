However	_	_

In	_	_

a	_	_

then	_	_
it	_	_
trains	_	_
a	_	_
separate	_	_

Conclusion	_	_

#114
In	_	_
this	_	_
paper	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
proposed	_	_
a	_	_
context-aware	_	_
network	_	_
for	_	_
automated	_	_
classification	_	_
of	_	_
breast	_	_
cancer	_	_
histology	_	_
images	_	_
.	_	_

#115
The	_	_
proposed	_	_
method	_	_
leverages	_	_
the	_	_
power	_	_
of	_	_
CNNs	_	_
to	_	_
encode	_	_
the	_	_
representation	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
patch	_	_
into	_	_
high	_	_
dimensional	_	_
space	_	_
and	_	_
uses	_	_
traditional	_	_
machine	_	_
method	_	_
(	_	_
SVM	_	_
)	_	_
to	_	_
aggregate	_	_
the	_	_
contextual	_	_
information	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
high	_	_
dimensional	_	_
features	_	_
while	_	_
having	_	_
a	_	_
limited	_	_
dataset	_	_
.	_	_

#116
Our	_	_
proposed	_	_
approach	_	_
outperformed	_	_
the	_	_
existing	_	_
methods	_	_
proposed	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_

task	_	_

The	_	_

is	_	_
not	_	_

task	_	_

#118
It	_	_

both	_	_
