CONCLUSION	_	_
This	_	_

proposes	_	_
the	_	_
modeling	_	_

#220
The	_	_
computing	_	_
speed	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
algorithm	_	_
is	_	_
attributed	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
fact	_	_
that	_	_
it	_	_
deviates	_	_
from	_	_
traditional	_	_
Boolean	_	_
Tensor	_	_
Factorization	_	_
approach	_	_
and	_	_
adopts	_	_
an	_	_

approach	_	_
in	_	_
finding	_	_
the	_	_

#221
The	_	_
execution	_	_

the	_	_

on	_	_
the	_	_
convergence	_	_

The	_	_
