ABSTRACT	_	_
This	_	_
paper	_	_
proposes	_	_
three	_	_
measures	_	_
to	_	_
quantify	_	_
the	_	_
characteristics	_	_
of	_	_
online	_	_
signature	_	_
templates	_	_
in	_	_
terms	_	_
of	_	_
distinctiveness	_	_
,	_	_
complexity	_	_
and	_	_
repeatability	_	_
.	_	_

#1
A	_	_
distinctiveness	_	_
measure	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
signature	_	_
template	_	_
is	_	_
computed	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
set	_	_
of	_	_
enrolled	_	_
signature	_	_
samples	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
statistical	_	_
assumption	_	_
about	_	_
random	_	_
signatures	_	_
.	_	_

#2
Secondly	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
complexity	_	_
measure	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
template	_	_
is	_	_
derived	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
set	_	_
of	_	_
enrolled	_	_
signature	_	_
samples	_	_
.	_	_

#3
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
given	_	_
a	_	_
signature	_	_
template	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
measure	_	_
to	_	_
quantify	_	_
the	_	_
repeatability	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
online	_	_
signature	_	_
is	_	_
derived	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
validation	_	_
set	_	_
of	_	_
samples	_	_
.	_	_

#4
These	_	_
three	_	_
measures	_	_
can	_	_
then	_	_
be	_	_
used	_	_
as	_	_
an	_	_
indicator	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
performance	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
system	_	_
in	_	_
rejecting	_	_
random	_	_
forgery	_	_
samples	_	_
and	_	_
skilled	_	_

samples	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
performance	_	_
of	_	_
users	_	_
in	_	_
providing	_	_
accepted	_	_
genuine	_	_
samples	_	_
,	_	_
respectively	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
effectiveness	_	_
of	_	_
these	_	_
three	_	_
measures	_	_
and	_	_
their	_	_
applications	_	_
are	_	_
demonstrated	_	_
through	_	_
experiments	_	_
performed	_	_
on	_	_

This	_	_
problem	_	_
has	_	_
led	_	_
to	_	_
many	_	_
studies	_	_
related	_	_
to	_	_
assessing	_	_
password	_	_
strength	_	_
and	_	_
also	_	_
the	_	_

the	_	_
enrollment	_	_
stage	_	_

#12
Similarly	_	_
,	_	_
there	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
need	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
assessment	_	_
of	_	_
biometric	_	_
template	_	_
characteristics	_	_
when	_	_
enrollment	_	_
is	_	_
done	_	_
without	_	_
supervision	_	_
[	_	_
18	_	_
]	_	_
,	_	_
e.g.	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
mobile	_	_
device	_	_
authentication	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
rejecting	_	_
samples	_	_
that	_	_
could	_	_
lead	_	_
to	_	_
degradation	_	_
of	_	_
performance	_	_
.	_	_

#13
This	_	_
is	_	_
especially	_	_
true	_	_
for	_	_
behavioral	_	_
biometric	_	_
based	_	_
authentication	_	_
techniques	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
online	_	_
signatures	_	_
or	_	_
key	_	_
stroke	_	_
dynamics	_	_
.	_	_

#14
In	_	_
behavioral	_	_
biometric	_	_
verification	_	_
systems	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
difficult	_	_
to	_	_
collect	_	_
a	_	_
set	_	_
of	_	_
negative	_	_
samples	_	_
that	_	_
could	_	_
accurately	_	_
represent	_	_
a	_	_
population	_	_
.	_	_

#15
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
user	_	_
specific	_	_
template	_	_
is	_	_
generally	_	_
modeled	_	_
based	_	_
purely	_	_
on	_	_
a	_	_
small	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_
enrolled	_	_
samples	_	_
,	_	_
without	_	_
using	_	_
imposter	_	_
samples	_	_
.	_	_

#16
Hence	_	_
,	_	_
at	_	_
a	_	_
given	_	_
threshold	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
verification	_	_
performance	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
profoundly	_	_
different	_	_
from	_	_
one	_	_
template	_	_
to	_	_
another	_	_
.	_	_

#17
For	_	_
example	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
online	_	_
signature	_	_
authentication	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
user	_	_
may	_	_
enroll	_	_
a	_	_
template	_	_
that	_	_
is	_	_
very	_	_
simple	_	_
.	_	_

#18
As	_	_
a	_	_
result	_	_
,	_	_
attackers	_	_
could	_	_
easily	_	_
produce	_	_
a	_	_
signature	_	_
that	_	_
matches	_	_
the	_	_
template	_	_

resulting	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
compromised	_	_

#101
The	_	_

on	_	_
statistical	_	_

derived	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_

#102
Specifically	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
features	_	_
used	_	_
here	_	_
are	_	_
histograms	_	_

the	_	_
first	_	_
and	_	_
second	_	_
halves	_	_
of	_	_
an	_	_
online	_	_
signature	_	_
.	_	_

#103
The	_	_
first	_	_
step	_	_
is	_	_
to	_	_
compute	_	_
statistics	_	_
of	_	_

The	_	_
statistics	_	_

#105
However	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_

to	_	_
collect	_	_
a	_	_
set	_	_

#106
In	_	_

,	_	_
statistics	_	_
derived	_	_
from	_	_
actual	_	_
signatures	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
dataset	_	_

in	_	_

a	_	_
general	_	_

about	_	_

about	_	_
the	_	_

used	_	_
to	_	_
compute	_	_

#108
This	_	_
is	_	_
in	_	_

#109
Then	_	_
the	_	_

were	_	_

#173
The	_	_
two	_	_

are	_	_

#174
For	_	_
DTW	_	_
approach	_	_

we	_	_
have	_	_
implemented	_	_
the	_	_
algorithm	_	_
using	_	_
4	_	_
sequences	_	_
which	_	_
are	_	_
x-y	_	_

of	_	_

#175
For	_	_
the	_	_
x-y	_	_

the	_	_
sequence	_	_
is	_	_

the	_	_
first	_	_
coordinate	_	_
is	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_

#176
Then	_	_
the	_	_
pairwise	_	_
distance	_	_
between	_	_
two	_	_

#177
Lastly	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
dissimilarity	_	_

was	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_
all	_	_

distance	_	_
between	_	_

#178
For	_	_

For	_	_

it	_	_

at	_	_

the	_	_

different	_	_
in	_	_
these	_	_
two	_	_

.	_	_

#205
One	_	_
possible	_	_
explanation	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_

,	_	_
the	_	_
users	_	_
did	_	_
not	_	_
use	_	_

,	_	_
but	_	_
instead	_	_
were	_	_
asked	_	_
to	_	_
create	_	_
new	_	_
signatures	_	_
specifically	_	_
for	_	_
experimental	_	_
purpose	_	_
[	_	_

]	_	_
.	_	_

#206
Consequently	_	_
,	_	_
signatures	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
dataset	_	_
were	_	_
expected	_	_
to	_	_
exhibit	_	_
a	_	_
higher	_	_
level	_	_
of	_	_
variation	_	_
.	_	_

#207
As	_	_
a	_	_
result	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
lower	_	_
FAR	_	_
was	_	_
achieved	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
threshold	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_

#208
Similarly	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
NYU	_	_
dataset	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
group	_	_
of	_	_
template	_	_
with	_	_
lower	_	_

score	_	_
consistently	_	_
corresponds	_	_
to	_	_
higher	_	_
average	_	_
FAR	_	_
across	_	_
the	_	_
threshold	_	_
range	_	_

#209
This	_	_
result	_	_
confirms	_	_
the	_	_
efficacy	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
distinctiveness	_	_
metric	_	_
regardless	_	_
of	_	_

characteristics	_	_

the	_	_
algorithms	_	_
used	_	_

#210
However	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
should	_	_
be	_	_
note	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
range	_	_
of	_	_
threshold	_	_
and	_	_
distinctiveness	_	_
scores	_	_
of	_	_
signature	_	_
templates	_	_
are	_	_
not	_	_
directly	_	_
comparable	_	_
with	_	_
that	_	_
of	_	_
those	_	_
two	_	_
datasets	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
unavailability	_	_
of	_	_
pressure	_	_
information	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
NYU	_	_
dataset	_	_
.	_	_

#211
Lastly	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
acknowledge	_	_
that	_	_
,	_	_
since	_	_
negative	_	_
samples	_	_
were	_	_
drawn	_	_
from	_	_
samples	_	_

#212
Correspondingly	_	_

this	_	_

#219
Specifically	_	_

DISCUSSION	_	_
AND	_	_
FUTURE	_	_
WORK	_	_
This	_	_
paper	_	_
presents	_	_
three	_	_
measures	_	_
,	_	_
namely	_	_
distinctiveness	_	_
,	_	_
complexity	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
repeatability	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
online	_	_
signature	_	_
templates	_	_
.	_	_

#359
These	_	_
are	_	_
three	_	_
important	_	_
aspects	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
biometric	_	_
system	_	_
that	_	_
operates	_	_
in	_	_
an	_	_
unsupervised	_	_
setting	_	_
not	_	_
only	_	_
because	_	_
the	_	_
issues	_	_
are	_	_
more	_	_
likely	_	_
to	_	_
occur	_	_
but	_	_
when	_	_
they	_	_
occur	_	_
they	_	_
must	_	_
be	_	_
detected	_	_
automatically	_	_
.	_	_

#360
The	_	_
measures	_	_
are	_	_
based	_	_
on	_	_
general	_	_
statistics	_	_
and	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
derived	_	_
from	_	_
any	_	_
feature-based	_	_
biometric	_	_
template	_	_
with	_	_
fixed	_	_
length	_	_
feature	_	_
vectors	_	_
and	_	_
hence	_	_
they	_	_
can	_	_
also	_	_
be	_	_
applied	_	_
to	_	_
other	_	_
types	_	_
of	_	_
biometric	_	_
recognition	_	_
systems	_	_
.	_	_

#361
The	_	_
proposed	_	_
distinctiveness	_	_
measure	_	_
simultaneously	_	_
incorporates	_	_
the	_	_
intrinsic	_	_
difference	_	_
as	_	_
well	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
consistency	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
set	_	_
of	_	_
enrolled	_	_
samples	_	_
.	_	_

#362
The	_	_
results	_	_
evaluated	_	_
on	_	_
three	_	_
datasets	_	_
confirmed	_	_
the	_	_
efficacy	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
proposed	_	_
metric	_	_
in	_	_
distinguishing	_	_
between	_	_
high	_	_
and	_	_
low	_	_
false	_	_

terms	_	_
of	_	_
complexity	_	_
and	_	_
repeatability	_	_
metric	_	_
were	_	_
investigated	_	_
.	_	_

#365
Experiments	_	_
confirmed	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
complexity	_	_
and	_	_
repeatability	_	_
of	_	_
templates	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
inferred	_	_
from	_	_
an	_	_
enrollment	_	_
set	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
validation	_	_

that	_	_

One	_	_
