The	_	_

the	_	_

Again	_	_

Both	_	_

interfere	_	_
with	_	_

While	_	_

a	_	_

#208
The	_	_

However	_	_

Hence	_	_

the	_	_

#212
A	_	_
relevant	_	_
observation	_	_
to	_	_

made	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_

a	_	_
consistent	_	_
level	_	_
of	_	_

#213
In	_	_
Figure	_	_

it	_	_
is	_	_

to	_	_

that	_	_

#214
The	_	_
reason	_	_
for	_	_
this	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
expert	_	_

for	_	_
this	_	_

the	_	_

#215
In	_	_

segmentation	_	_
for	_	_
this	_	_

for	_	_
each	_	_

#216
Another	_	_
point	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
made	_	_
about	_	_
Figure	_	_

is	_	_
that	_	_
patient	_	_

presented	_	_
the	_	_
biggest	_	_
standard	_	_
deviation	_	_
of	_	_
all	_	_

#217
This	_	_
result	_	_
came	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
fact	_	_
that	_	_
this	_	_
patient’s	_	_
lesion	_	_

faded	_	_
across	_	_
time-points	_	_

making	_	_
the	_	_

#218
This	_	_
fading	_	_
phenomenon	_	_
can	_	_
also	_	_
be	_	_
seen	_	_
in	_	_
Figures	_	_
5	_	_
and	_	_

since	_	_

#220
Though	_	_
a	_	_
direct	_	_

is	_	_
not	_	_
possible	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_

#221
Contrary	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
authors	_	_
approach	_	_

our	_	_

only	_	_

#222
It	_	_
is	_	_
important	_	_
to	_	_

that	_	_
our	_	_

#223
However	_	_

we	_	_

that	_	_
it	_	_

to	_	_
extend	_	_
our	_	_

This	_	_

for	_	_

#231
The	_	_
HI	_	_

is	_	_
heavily	_	_
based	_	_
on	_	_
gray	_	_

has	_	_
two	_	_
drawbacks	_	_
worth	_	_
of	_	_
notice	_	_
.	_	_

#232
The	_	_
first	_	_
one	_	_
regards	_	_
the	_	_
intensity	_	_
variation	_	_
within	_	_
lesions	_	_
since	_	_
the	_	_
difference	_	_
in	_	_
intensity	_	_
from	_	_
one	_	_
lesion	_	_
to	_	_
another	_	_
in	_	_
FLAIR	_	_
is	_	_
propagated	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
map	_	_
.	_	_

#233
The	_	_
second	_	_
drawback	_	_
regards	_	_
regions	_	_
that	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
have	_	_
lesions	_	_
but	_	_
also	_	_
appear	_	_
hyperintense	_	_
in	_	_
FLAIR	_	_
.	_	_

#234
These	_	_
regions	_	_
are	_	_
also	_	_
enhanced	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
map	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
may	_	_
lead	_	_
to	_	_
false	_	_
positives	_	_
.	_	_

#235
Due	_	_
to	_	_
this	_	_
reason	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
HI	_	_
map	_	_
should	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
used	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
stand-alone	_	_
feature	_	_
in	_	_
applications	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
tissue	_	_
or	_	_
lesion	_	_
segmentation	_	_
.	_	_

#236
A	_	_
byproduct	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
HI	_	_
map	_	_
is	_	_
an	_	_
initial	_	_
estimate	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
white	_	_
matter	_	_
mask	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
given	_	_
time-point	_	_
.	_	_

#237
Automatically	_	_
segmenting	_	_
a	_	_
brain	_	_
image	_	_
with	_	_
multiple	_	_
sclerosis	_	_
into	_	_
three	_	_
clusters	_	_
(	_	_
white	_	_
matter	_	_
,	_	_
gray	_	_
matter	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
cerebral	_	_
spinal	_	_
fluid	_	_
)	_	_
will	_	_
undoubtedly	_	_
mix	_	_
lesions	_	_
with	_	_
other	_	_
tissues	_	_
.	_	_

#238
In	_	_
this	_	_
sense	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
can	_	_
simply	_	_
get	_	_
the	_	_
white	_	_
matter	_	_
cluster	_	_
mask	_	_
and	_	_
fill	_	_
regions	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
not	_	_
yet	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
mask	_	_
but	_	_
are	_	_
above	_	_
a	_	_
certain	_	_
threshold	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
map	_	_
to	_	_
get	_	_
a	_	_
“full”	_	_
WM	_	_
mask	_	_
.	_	_

#239
The	_	_
estimation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
white	_	_
matter	_	_
area	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
relevant	_	_
to	_	_
narrow	_	_
down	_	_
the	_	_
ROI	_	_
when	_	_
segmenting	_	_
lesions	_	_
and	_	_
also	_	_
help	_	_
with	_	_
brain	_	_
tissue	_	_
segmentation	_	_
and	_	_
volume	_	_
assessment	_	_
.	_	_

#240
We	_	_
showed	_	_
that	_	_
lesions	_	_
have	_	_
an	_	_
intensity	_	_
profile	_	_
that	_	_
is	_	_
brighter	_	_
than	_	_
white	_	_
matter	_	_
than	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
to	_	_
gray	_	_
matter	_	_
,	_	_
so	_	_
we	_	_
believe	_	_
that	_	_
restricting	_	_
the	_	_
segmentation	_	_
area	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
mask	_	_
that	_	_
excludes	_	_
most	_	_
gray	_	_
matter	_	_
region	_	_
might	capability-speculation	_
increase	_	_
lesion	_	_
segmentation	_	_
accuracy	_	_
.	_	_

#241
However	_	_

the	_	_
two	_	_
problems	_	_
mentioned	_	_

about	_	_
the	_	_
HI	_	_

affected	_	_
the	_	_

the	_	_

this	_	_

the	_	_

a	_	_
much	_	_
more	_	_
distinct	_	_
profile	_	_
for	_	_

white	_	_

gray	_	_

tissues	_	_
in	_	_

such	_	_

the	_	_
problems	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_

extending	_	_
the	_	_
