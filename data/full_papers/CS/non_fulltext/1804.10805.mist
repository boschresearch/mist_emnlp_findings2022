Abstract	_	_
Idling	_	_
vehicles	_	_
waste	_	_
energy	_	_
and	_	_
pollute	_	_
the	_	_
environment	_	_
through	_	_
exhaust	_	_
emission	_	_
.	_	_

#3
In	_	_
some	_	_
countries	_	_
,	_	_
idling	_	_
a	_	_
vehicle	_	_
for	_	_
more	_	_
than	_	_
a	_	_
predefined	_	_
duration	_	_
is	_	_
prohibited	_	_
and	_	_
automatic	_	_
idling	_	_
vehicle	_	_
detection	_	_
is	_	_
desirable	_	_
for	_	_
law	_	_
enforcement	_	_
.	_	_

#4
We	_	_
propose	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
automatic	_	_
system	_	_
to	_	_
detect	_	_
idling	_	_
cars	_	_
,	_	_
using	_	_
infrared	_	_
(	_	_
IR	_	_
)	_	_
imaging	_	_
and	_	_
deep	_	_
networks	_	_
.	_	_

#5
We	_	_
rely	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
differences	_	_
in	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
heat	_	_
signatures	_	_
of	_	_
idling	_	_
and	_	_
stopped	_	_
cars	_	_
and	_	_
monitor	_	_
the	_	_
car	_	_
temperature	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
long-wavelength	_	_
IR	_	_
camera	_	_
.	_	_

#6
We	_	_
formulate	_	_
the	_	_
idling	_	_
car	_	_
detection	_	_
problem	_	_
as	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
event	_	_
detection	_	_
in	_	_
IR	_	_
image	_	_
sequences	_	_
and	_	_
employ	_	_
deep	_	_
networks	_	_
for	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
modeling	_	_
.	_	_

#7
We	_	_
collected	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
IR	_	_
image	_	_
sequence	_	_
dataset	_	_
for	_	_
idling	_	_
car	_	_
detection	_	_
.	_	_

#8
First	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
detect	_	_
the	_	_
cars	_	_
in	_	_
each	_	_
IR	_	_
image	_	_
using	_	_
a	_	_
convolutional	_	_
neural	_	_
network	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
is	_	_
pre-trained	_	_
on	_	_
regular	_	_
RGB	_	_
images	_	_
and	_	_
fine-tuned	_	_
on	_	_
IR	_	_
images	_	_
for	_	_
higher	_	_
accuracy	_	_
.	_	_

#9
Then	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
track	_	_
the	_	_
detected	_	_
cars	_	_
over	_	_
time	_	_
to	_	_
identify	_	_
the	_	_
cars	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
parked	_	_
.	_	_

#10
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
use	_	_
the	_	_
3D	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
IR	_	_
image	_	_
volume	_	_
of	_	_
each	_	_
parked	_	_
car	_	_
as	_	_
input	_	_
to	_	_
convolutional	_	_
and	_	_
recurrent	_	_
networks	_	_
to	_	_
classify	_	_
them	_	_
as	_	_
idling	_	_
or	_	_
not	_	_
.	_	_

#11
We	_	_
carried	_	_
out	_	_
an	_	_
extensive	_	_
empirical	_	_
evaluation	_	_
of	_	_
temporal	_	_
and	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
modeling	_	_
approaches	_	_
with	_	_
various	_	_
convolutional	_	_
and	_	_
recurrent	_	_
architectures	_	_

We	_	_

Fuel	_	_

#15
Idling	_	_
for	_	_
6	_	_
minutes	_	_

the	_	_

#16
Increased	_	_
exhaust	_	_

#19
One	_	_

to	_	_
reduce	_	_

#20
In	_	_
line	_	_
with	_	_
this	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
Singapore	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
prohibited	_	_
to	_	_
keep	_	_
a	_	_
vehicle	_	_
idling	_	_
for	_	_
more	_	_
than	_	_
3	_	_
minutes	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
reasons	_	_
other	_	_
than	_	_
traffic	_	_
conditions	_	_
.	_	_

#21
Currently	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
regulation	_	_
is	_	_
enforced	_	_
by	_	_
human	_	_
officers	_	_
by	_	_
manually	_	_
checking	_	_
if	_	_
a	_	_
parked	_	_
vehicle	_	_
is	_	_
idling	_	_
or	_	_
not	_	_
.	_	_

#22
It	_	_
is	_	_
desirable	_	_
to	_	_
employ	_	_
an	_	_
automatic	_	_
system	_	_
for	_	_
monitoring	_	_
,	_	_
since	_	_
manual	_	_
checking	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
practical	_	_

#23
Moreover	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
automatic	_	_
system	_	_
can	_	_
also	_	_
archive	_	_

#24
Motivated	_	_
by	_	_
this	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
propose	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_

to	_	_
detect	_	_

thermal	_	_

(	_	_
IR	_	_
)	_	_
camera	_	_

#25
The	_	_
intuition	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
there	_	_
should	_	_
be	_	_
differences	_	_

#26
In	_	_
an	_	_

the	_	_
engine	_	_
temperature	_	_
at	_	_
a	_	_
specific	_	_
level	_	_
;	_	_
the	_	_
air	_	_

be	_	_
active	_	_
to	_	_
regulate	_	_
the	_	_
internal	_	_
car	_	_
temperature	_	_

#27
When	_	_
the	_	_
engine	_	_
is	_	_
turned	_	_
off	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
heat	_	_
inside	_	_
the	_	_

to	_	_

out	_	_

first	_	_
heating	_	_
up	_	_
the	_	_
car	_	_
for	_	_
some	_	_

then	_	_

the	_	_

Method	_	_
Overview	_	_

#46
We	_	_
propose	_	_
the	_	_
framework	_	_
shown	_	_
in	_	_
Figure	_	_
1	_	_
to	_	_
detect	_	_
idling	_	_
cars	_	_
.	_	_

#47
First	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
use	_	_
an	_	_
IR	_	_
camera	_	_
to	_	_
obtain	_	_
IR	_	_
image	_	_
sequences	_	_
,	_	_
hence	_	_
the	_	_
temperature	_	_
,	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
whole	_	_
car	_	_
park	_	_
.	_	_

#48
Then	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
apply	_	_
car	_	_
detection	_	_
on	_	_
each	_	_
IR	_	_
image	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
sequence	_	_
to	_	_
localize	_	_
the	_	_
cars	_	_
and	_	_
then	_	_
,	_	_
further	_	_
track	_	_
them	_	_
to	_	_
identify	_	_
stationary/parked	_	_
cars	_	_
.	_	_

#49
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
classify	_	_
the	_	_
detected	_	_
stationary	_	_
cars	_	_
as	_	_
idling	_	_
or	_	_
not	_	_
.	_	_

#50
We	_	_
experimented	_	_
with	_	_
two	_	_
different	_	_
approaches	_	_
for	_	_
classification	_	_
:	_	_
(	_	_

Using	_	_
the	_	_
temporal	_	_

an	_	_

#58
We	_	_
used	_	_

could	_	_

#63
It	_	_

#64
All	_	_
in	_	_

#65
We	_	_
setup	_	_

#233
Even	_	_
though	_	_
the	_	_
rear	_	_

seemed	_	_
easier	_	_
judging	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
maximum	_	_

(	_	_

,	_	_
the	_	_

seems	_	_
not	_	_
to	_	_
have	_	_
learned	_	_
it	_	_
well	_	_
,	_	_
maybe	_	_
because	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
small	_	_
area	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
exhaust	_	_

compared	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
whole	_	_

.	_	_

#234
Another	_	_
reason	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
exhaust	_	_
pipe	_	_
of	_	_
one	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
cars	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

hidden	_	_
and	_	_
not	_	_
visible	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

.	_	_

#235
Based	_	_
on	_	_
these	_	_
cross	_	_
validation	_	_
results	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
can	_	_
say	_	_
that	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
CNN	_	_
model	_	_
is	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
generalize	_	_
across	_	_
the	_	_
majority	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
car	_	_
models	_	_
,	_	_
i.e.	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
CNN	_	_
can	_	_
learn	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
features	_	_
to	_	_
differentiate	_	_
idling	_	_
and	_	_
stopped	_	_
cars	_	_
even	_	_
if	_	_
the	_	_
cars	_	_
are	_	_
different	_	_
and	_	_
their	_	_
spatio-temporal	_	_
heat	_	_
maps	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
look	_	_
visually	_	_
very	_	_
similar	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
human	_	_
eye	_	_
(	_	_
Figure	_	_
3	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#236
This	_	_
means	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
need	_	_
to	_	_
collect	_	_
training	_	_
data	_	_
for	_	_
all	_	_
types	_	_
of	_	_
different	_	_
car	_	_
models	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
would	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
practical	_	_
.	_	_

#237
We	_	_
also	_	_
trained	_	_
separate	_	_
CNNs	_	_
for	_	_
each	_	_
view	_	_
,	_	_
however	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
performance	_	_
was	_	_
either	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
or	_	_
slightly	_	_
lower	_	_
.	_	_

#238
This	_	_
might	speculation	_
be	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
reduced	_	_
amount	_	_
of	_	_
training	_	_

e.g.	_	_
,	_	_

,	_	_

.	_	_

#241
The	_	_
major	_	_
difficulty	_	_
is	_	_
training	_	_
and	_	_
evaluating	_	_
the	_	_
CNN	_	_
on	_	_
a	_	_
fairly	_	_
small	_	_

#242

data	_	_

#243
Another	_	_
problem	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
difference	_	_
between	_	_
the	_	_
training	_	_
and	_	_

data	_	_
distributions	_	_
,	_	_
when	_	_
the	_	_

the	_	_
