The	_	_

that	_	_
this	_	_

was	_	_
caused	_	_
by	_	_

Conclusions	_	_
The	_	_

the	_	_
Pyrenean	_	_
Gulf	_	_
across	_	_
the	_	_
P–E	_	_
boundary	_	_
interval	_	_
can	_	_
satisfactorily	_	_
be	_	_
explained	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
dramatic	_	_
and	_	_
abrupt	_	_
change	_	_
in	_	_
hydrology	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
pre-PETM	_	_

#389
During	_	_
the	_	_

,	_	_
whereas	_	_
precipitation	_	_

As	_	_
a	_	_
result	_	_
,	_	_
during	_	_

Delivery	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
increased	_	_
sediment	_	_
load	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_

was	_	_
facilitated	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
low	_	_
position	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
sea	_	_
level	_	_
.	_	_

#393
A	_	_
fraction	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
bed	_	_
load	_	_
was	_	_
accumulated	_	_
within	_	_
incised	_	_
valleys	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
had	_	_
been	_	_
excavated	_	_
during	_	_
a	_	_
pre-PETM	_	_

The	_	_

#395
Deposition	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_

#396
This	_	_
implies	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_

a	_	_
much	_	_

The	_	_
influx	_	_
of	_	_
kaolinite	_	_
during	_	_
the	_	_

due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_

developed	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
