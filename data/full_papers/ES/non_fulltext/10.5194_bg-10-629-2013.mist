#445
To	_	_
test	_	_
this	_	_
idea	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
modified	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
to	_	_
include	_	_
intracellular	_	_

a	_	_
new	_	_

variable	_	_
(	_	_

#446
The	_	_
basic	_	_
premise	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
luxury	_	_
uptake	_	_
of	_	_
TPO4	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
porewater	_	_
by	_	_
Beggiatoa	_	_
takes	_	_
place	_	_
during	_	_
periods	_	_
of	_	_
oxygenated	_	_
bottom	_	_
waters	_	_
,	_	_
whereas	_	_
net	_	_
release	_	_
of	_	_
intracellular	_	_
P	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
porewater	_	_
as	_	_
TPO4	_	_
occurs	_	_
during	_	_
hypoxia	_	_
.	_	_

#447
Although	_	_
Beggiatoa	_	_
could	capability-speculation	_
conceivably	_	_
take	_	_
up	_	_
TPO4	_	_
directly	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
bottom	_	_
water	_	_
by	_	_
extension	_	_
of	_	_
their	_	_
filaments	_	_
through	_	_
the	_	_
diffusive	_	_
boundary	_	_
layer	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
seems	_	_
more	_	_
plausible	_	_
that	_	_
they	_	_
instead	_	_
capitalize	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
porewater	_	_
TPO4	_	_
pool	_	_
where	_	_
concentrations	_	_
are	_	_
at	_	_

order-of-magnitude	_	_

#448
Thus	_	_
,	_	_
if	_	_
Beggiatoa	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
considered	_	_
as	_	_
viable	_	_
candidates	_	_
for	_	_
enhanced	_	_
phosphorus	_	_
cycling	_	_
in	_	_
Boknis	_	_

the	_	_

to	_	_
be	_	_
sufficient	_	_
to	_	_
sustain	_	_
the	_	_
TPO4	_	_
peak	_	_
when	_	_
taken	_	_
up	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
bacteria	_	_
and	_	_
then	_	_
released	_	_

Conclusions	_	_
This	_	_
study	_	_
presents	_	_
a	_	_
time	_	_
series	_	_
of	_	_
porewater	_	_
data	_	_
from	_	_
a	_	_
seasonally	_	_
hypoxic	_	_
coastal	_	_
setting	_	_
which	_	_
is	_	_
analyzed	_	_
using	_	_
a	_	_
numerical	_	_
model	_	_
to	_	_
quantify	_	_
benthic	_	_
processes	_	_
and	_	_
fluxes	_	_
.	_	_

#478
Clear	_	_
transient	_	_
signals	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
data	_	_
are	_	_
interpreted	_	_
as	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_
both	_	_
reaction	_	_
rates	_	_
and	_	_
transport	_	_
processes	_	_
(	_	_
mainly	_	_
bioirrigation	_	_
and	_	_
bubble	_	_
irrigation	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#479
If	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
predictions	_	_
are	_	_
correct	_	_
,	_	_
then	_	_
the	_	_
patterns	_	_
of	_	_
nutrient	_	_
cycling	_	_
in	_	_
Boknis	_	_
Eck	_	_
sediments	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
more	_	_
widely	_	_
applicable	_	_
.	_	_

#480
Firstly	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
have	_	_
shown	_	_
that	_	_
solute	_	_
exchange	_	_
between	_	_
the	_	_
sediments	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_
column	_	_
is	_	_
dominated	_	_
by	_	_
bioirrigation	_	_
in	_	_
winter	_	_
and	_	_
spring	_	_
and	_	_
by	_	_
bubble-induced	_	_
irrigation	_	_
at	_	_
irregular	_	_
intervals	_	_
from	_	_
late	_	_
spring	_	_
to	_	_
autumn	_	_
.	_	_

#481
Molecular	_	_
diffusion	_	_
remains	_	_
important	_	_
for	_	_
highly	_	_
reactive	_	_
species	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
O2	_	_
and	_	_
NO−	_	_
3	_	_
.	_	_

#482
Secondly	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
very	_	_
large	_	_
transient	_	_
peak	_	_
in	_	_
TPO4	_	_
in	_	_
excess	_	_
of	_	_
400	_	_
µM	_	_
develops	_	_
in	_	_
subsurface	_	_
sediments	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
end	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
hypoxic	_	_
period	_	_
in	_	_
October	_	_
.	_	_

#483
This	_	_
leads	_	_
to	_	_
an	_	_
extreme	_	_
enrichment	_	_
of	_	_
P	_	_
relative	_	_
to	_	_
C	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
fluxes	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
and	_	_
coincides	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
dramatic	_	_
lowering	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
N/P	_	_
ratio	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
overlying	_	_
water	_	_
column	_	_
.	_	_

#484
This	_	_
is	_	_
mainly	_	_
driven	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
large	_	_
pulsed	_	_
release	_	_
of	_	_
TPO4	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
porewater	_	_
within	_	_
a	_	_
short	_	_
space	_	_
of	_	_
time	_	_
(	_	_
∼	_	_
weeks	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#485
Based	_	_
on	_	_
published	_	_
field	_	_
evidence	_	_
and	_	_
laboratory	_	_
experiments	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
were	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
reproduce	_	_
this	_	_
peak	_	_
using	_	_
new	_	_
kinetic	_	_
expressions	_	_
that	_	_
allow	_	_
the	_	_
giant	_	_
sulfide-oxidizing	_	_
bacteria	_	_
Beggiatoa	_	_
to	_	_
take	_	_
up	_	_
TPO4	_	_
during	_	_
periods	_	_
of	_	_
oxic	_	_
bottom	_	_
waters	_	_
and	_	_
release	_	_
TPO4	_	_
when	_	_
oxygen	_	_
drops	_	_
to	_	_
low	_	_
levels	_	_
(	_	_
∼	_	_
10	_	_
µM	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#486
This	_	_
does	_	_
not	_	_
require	_	_
an	_	_
external	_	_
source	_	_
of	_	_
TPO4	_	_
and	_	_
agrees	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
known	_	_
distribution	_	_
of	_	_
Beggiatoa	_	_
in	_	_
these	_	_
sediments	_	_
.	_	_

#487
Alternative	_	_
sources	_	_
of	_	_
TPO4	_	_
,	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
from	_	_
Fe–P	_	_
and	_	_
organic	_	_
P	_	_
,	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
provide	_	_
a	_	_
satisfactory	_	_
simulation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
data	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
can	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
ruled	_	_
out	_	_
indefinitely	_	_
at	_	_
this	_	_
stage	_	_
.	_	_

#488
Further	_	_
work	_	_
is	_	_
required	_	_
to	_	_
substantiate	_	_
our	_	_
findings	_	_
.	_	_

#489
Although	_	_
there	_	_
are	_	_
several	_	_
pieces	_	_
of	_	_
circumstantial	_	_
evidence	_	_
in	_	_
support	_	_
of	_	_
pseudo-irrigation	_	_
by	_	_
gas	_	_
bubble	_	_
transport	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
has	_	_
yet	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
shown	_	_
experimentally	_	_
.	_	_

#490
Given	_	_
the	_	_
apparently	_	_
episodic	_	_
nature	_	_
of	_	_
gas	_	_
eruption	_	_
,	_	_
continuous	_	_
monitoring	_	_
of	_	_
gas	_	_
escape	_	_
and	_	_
sediment	_	_
porewater	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
needed	_	_
to	_	_
capture	_	_
these	_	_
events	_	_
and	_	_
corroborate	_	_
the	_	_
hypothesis	_	_
.	_	_

#491
Bubble	_	_
irrigation	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
more	_	_
common	_	_
than	_	_
currently	_	_
presumed	_	_
and	_	_
is	_	_
likely	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
overlooked	_	_
if	_	_
organic-rich	_	_
sediments	_	_
are	_	_
sampled	_	_
at	_	_
a	_	_
single	_	_
time	_	_
rather	_	_
than	_	_
as	_	_
part	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
time	_	_
series	_	_
study	_	_
.	_	_

#492
Our	_	_
suggestion	_	_
that	_	_
Beggiatoa	_	_
are	_	_
releasing	_	_
TPO4	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
strengthened	_	_
with	_	_
data	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
temporal	_	_
variability	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
fraction	_	_
of	_	_
TPO4	_	_
bound	_	_
to	_	_
iron	_	_
oxyhydroxides	_	_
as	_	_
well	_	_
as	_	_
intracellular	_	_
P	_	_
concentrations	_	_
.	_	_

#493
The	_	_
mechanism	_	_
and	_	_
regulation	_	_
of	_	_
P	_	_
storage	_	_
in	_	_
bacteria	_	_
is	_	_
poorly	_	_
understood	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
at	_	_
this	_	_
stage	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
known	_	_
whether	_	_
the	_	_
strain	_	_
of	_	_
Beggiatoa	_	_
at	_	_
Boknis	_	_
Eck	_	_
is	_	_
capable	_	_
of	_	_
intermediate	_	_
polyphosphate	_	_
storage	_	_
.	_	_

#494
Sampling	_	_
at	_	_
bi-weekly	_	_
intervals	_	_
with	_	_
additional	_	_
support	_	_
from	_	_
benthic	_	_
chamber	_	_
deployments	_	_
during	_	_
the	_	_
hypoxic	_	_
period	_	_
would	_	_
also	_	_
help	_	_
to	_	_
refine	_	_
future	_	_
modeling	_	_
work	_	_

precipitation	_	_
and	_	_
dissolution	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_

an	_	_

aspect	_	_
which	_	_
will	_	_
be	_	_
addressed	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
future	_	_
.	_	_

#496
The	_	_
strength	_	_
of	_	_
this	_	_
study	_	_
lies	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
quantification	_	_
of	_	_
transient	_	_
fluxes	_	_
and	_	_
process	_	_
rates	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
supported	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
set	_	_
of	_	_
temporally	_	_
resolved	_	_
benthic	_	_
data	_	_
.	_	_

#497
We	_	_
demonstrate	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
accurate	_	_
nutrient	_	_
budgeting	_	_
in	_	_
muddy	_	_
coastal	_	_
sediments	_	_
requires	_	_
a	_	_
careful	_	_
consideration	_	_
of	_	_
temporal	_	_
dynamics	_	_
.	_	_

#498
Nevertheless	_	_
,	_	_
there	_	_
are	_	_
very	_	_
few	_	_
published	_	_
modeling	_	_
studies	_	_
that	_	_
explore	_	_
seasonal	_	_
benthic	_	_
cycling	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
constrained	_	_
using	_	_
data	_	_
collected	_	_
at	_	_
sampling	_	_
frequencies	_	_
adequate	_	_
to	_	_
capture	_	_
the	_	_
transient	_	_
dynamics	_	_
(	_	_

#500
These	_	_
