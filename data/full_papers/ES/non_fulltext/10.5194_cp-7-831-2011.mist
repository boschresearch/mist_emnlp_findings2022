The	_	_

of	_	_
several	_	_
rapid	_	_
and	_	_
tremendously	_	_
large	_	_
carbon	_	_
injections	_	_
coming	_	_

As	_	_
hinted	_	_
at	_	_
by	_	_
Bowen	_	_
and	_	_
Zachos	_	_
(	_	_
2010	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
would	_	_
require	_	_
a	_	_
wholesale	_	_
rethinking	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
global	_	_
carbon	_	_
cycle	_	_
with	_	_
one	_	_
or	_	_
more	_	_
large	_	_
and	_	_
dynamic	_	_
terrestrial	_	_
“capacitors”	_	_
that	_	_
accumulate	_	_
and	_	_
release	_	_
13C-depleted	_	_
organic	_	_
carbon	_	_
throughout	_	_
time	_	_
,	_	_
with	_	_
carbon	_	_
inputs	_	_
and	_	_
outputs	_	_
somehow	_	_
coupled	_	_
to	_	_
conventional	_	_
reservoirs	_	_
and	_	_
responding	_	_
to	_	_
environmental	_	_
change	_	_
.	_	_

#344
It	_	_
would	_	_
also	_	_
necessitate	_	_
imagination	_	_
as	_	_
to	_	_
how	_	_
and	_	_
why	_	_
hugely	_	_
greater	_	_
quantities	_	_
of	_	_
mobile	_	_
terrestrial	_	_
organic	_	_
carbon	_	_
existed	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
past	_	_
.	_	_

#345
For	_	_
example	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
present-day	_	_
amount	_	_
of	_	_
organic	_	_
carbon	_	_
stored	_	_
in	_	_
permafrost	_	_
regions	_	_
is	_	_
probably	_	_
large	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
less	_	_
than	_	_
1000	_	_
Gt	_	_
(	_	_

.	_	_

#346
Moreover	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
total	_	_
is	_	_
high	_	_
only	_	_
because	_	_
approximately	_	_
500	_	_
Gt	_	_
is	_	_
associated	_	_
with	_	_
