Discussion	_	_
Here	_	_

we	_	_
provide	_	_
evidence	_	_
that	_	_
eDNA	_	_
originating	_	_
from	_	_
planktonic	_	_

is	_	_
indeed	_	_
preserved	_	_

#168
Earlier	_	_
eDNA	_	_
studies	_	_
on	_	_
marine	_	_
sediments	_	_
assumed	_	_
that	_	_
DNA	_	_
preservation	_	_
is	_	_
proportional	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
preservation	_	_
of	_	_
organic	_	_

,	_	_

,	_	_
prioritized	_	_

Yet	_	_
,	_	_
recent	_	_
experimental	_	_

that	_	_

is	_	_
adsorbed	_	_
to	_	_

preserved	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
way	_	_
may	_	_
form	_	_
an	_	_

Indeed	_	_
,	_	_
an	_	_
investigation	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_

that	_	_

the	_	_

that	_	_

#213
It	_	_
is	_	_
possible	_	_
that	_	_
DNA	_	_
in	_	_
“shelled”	_	_

the	_	_

#214
Such	_	_
selective	_	_
preservation	_	_
could	capability-speculation	_
alter	_	_

among	_	_

cell	_	_
architecture	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
the	_	_
observation	_	_
from	_	_
foraminifera	_	_
suggests	_	_
that	_	_
as	_	_
long	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
preservation	_	_
pattern	_	_
of	_	_
DNA	_	_
within	_	_
a	_	_

taxonomic	_	_

remains	_	_
similar	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
eDNA	_	_
of	_	_
such	_	_

should	inference	_
conserve	_	_
its	_	_
biogeographic	_	_

together	_	_

the	_	_
