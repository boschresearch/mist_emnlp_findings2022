#4
Laboratory-scale	_	_
experiments	_	_
of	_	_
erosion	_	_
have	_	_
demonstrated	_	_
that	_	_
landscapes	_	_
have	_	_
a	_	_
natural	_	_
(	_	_
or	_	_
intrinsic	_	_
)	_	_
response	_	_
time	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
change	_	_
in	_	_
precipitation	_	_
rate	_	_
.	_	_

#5
In	_	_
the	_	_
last	_	_
few	_	_
decades	_	_
there	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
growth	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
development	_	_
of	_	_
numerical	_	_
models	_	_
that	_	_
attempt	_	_
to	_	_
capture	_	_
landscape	_	_
evolution	_	_
over	_	_
long	_	_
timescales	_	_
.	_	_

#6
However	_	_
,	_	_
there	_	_
is	_	_
still	_	_
an	_	_
uncertainty	_	_
regarding	_	_
the	_	_
validity	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
basic	_	_
assumptions	_	_
of	_	_
mass	_	_
transport	_	_
that	_	_
are	_	_
made	_	_
in	_	_
deriving	_	_
these	_	_
models	_	_
.	_	_

#7
In	_	_
this	_	_
contribution	_	_
we	_	_
therefore	_	_
return	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
principal	_	_
assumption	_	_
of	_	_
sediment	_	_
transport	_	_
within	_	_
the	_	_
mass	_	_
balance	_	_
for	_	_
surface	_	_
processes	_	_
;	_	_
we	_	_
explore	_	_
the	_	_
sensitivity	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
classic	_	_
end-member	_	_
landscape	_	_
evolution	_	_
models	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
fluxes	_	_
they	_	_
produce	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
change	_	_
in	_	_
precipitation	_	_
rates	_	_
.	_	_

#8
One	_	_
end-member	_	_
model	_	_
takes	_	_
the	_	_
mathematical	_	_
form	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
kinetic	_	_
wave	_	_
equation	_	_
and	_	_
is	_	_
known	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
stream	_	_
power	_	_
model	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
which	_	_
sediment	_	_
is	_	_
assumed	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
transported	_	_
immediately	_	_
out	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
domain	_	_
.	_	_

#9
The	_	_
second	_	_
end-member	_	_
model	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
transport	_	_
model	_	_
and	_	_
it	_	_
takes	_	_
the	_	_
form	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
diffusion	_	_
equation	_	_
,	_	_
assuming	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
flux	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
function	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_
flux	_	_
and	_	_
slope	_	_
.	_	_

#10
We	_	_
find	_	_
that	_	_
both	_	_
of	_	_
these	_	_
end-member	_	_
models	_	_
have	_	_
a	_	_
response	_	_
time	_	_
that	_	_
has	_	_
a	_	_
proportionality	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
precipitation	_	_
rate	_	_
that	_	_
follows	_	_
a	_	_
negative	_	_
power	_	_
law	_	_
.	_	_

#11
However	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
stream	_	_
power	_	_
model	_	_
the	_	_
exponent	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_
flux	_	_
term	_	_
must	deontic	_
be	_	_
less	_	_
than	_	_
one	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
transport	_	_
model	_	_
the	_	_
exponent	_	_
must	deontic	_
be	_	_
greater	_	_
than	_	_
one	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
match	_	_
the	_	_
observed	_	_
concavity	_	_
of	_	_
natural	_	_
systems	_	_
.	_	_

#12
This	_	_
difference	_	_
in	_	_
exponent	_	_
means	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
transport	_	_
model	_	_
generally	_	_
responds	_	_
more	_	_
rapidly	_	_
to	_	_
an	_	_
increase	_	_
in	_	_
precipitation	_	_
rates	_	_
,	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
order	_	_
of	_	_
105	_	_
years	_	_
for	_	_
post-perturbation	_	_
sediment	_	_
fluxes	_	_
to	_	_
return	_	_
to	_	_
within	_	_
50	_	_
%	_	_
of	_	_
their	_	_
initial	_	_
values	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
theoretical	_	_
landscapes	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
scale	_	_
of	_	_
100	_	_
×	_	_
100	_	_
km	_	_
.	_	_

#13
Additionally	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
starting	_	_
conditions	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
amplitude	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
flux	_	_
perturbation	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
transport	_	_
model	_	_
is	_	_
greater	_	_
,	_	_
with	_	_
much	_	_
larger	_	_
sensitivity	_	_
to	_	_
catchment	_	_
size	_	_
.	_	_

#14
An	_	_
important	_	_
finding	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
both	_	_
models	_	_
respond	_	_
more	_	_
quickly	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
wetting	_	_
event	_	_
than	_	_
a	_	_
drying	_	_
event	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
we	_	_
argue	_	_
that	_	_
this	_	_
asymmetry	_	_
in	_	_
response	_	_
time	_	_
has	_	_
significant	_	_
implications	_	_
for	_	_
depositional	_	_
stratigraphies	_	_
.	_	_

#15
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
evaluate	_	_
the	_	_
extent	_	_
to	_	_
which	_	_
these	_	_
constraints	_	_
on	_	_
response	_	_
times	_	_
and	_	_
sediment	_	_
fluxes	_	_
from	_	_
simple	_	_
models	_	_
help	_	_
us	_	_
understand	_	_
the	_	_
geological	_	_
record	_	_
of	_	_
landscape	_	_
response	_	_
to	_	_
rapid	_	_
environmental	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
past	_	_
,	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
Paleocene–Eocene	_	_
thermal	_	_
maximum	_	_
(	_	_
PETM	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#16
In	_	_
the	_	_
Spanish	_	_
Pyrenees	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
instance	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
relatively	_	_
rapid	_	_
(	_	_
10	_	_
to	_	_
50	_	_
kyr	_	_
)	_	_
duration	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
deposition	_	_
of	_	_
gravel	_	_
is	_	_
observed	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
climatic	_	_
shift	_	_
that	_	_
is	_	_
thought	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
towards	_	_
increased	_	_
precipitation	_	_
rates	_	_
.	_	_

#17
We	_	_
suggest	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
rapid	_	_
response	_	_
observed	_	_
is	_	_
more	_	_
easily	_	_
explained	_	_
through	_	_
a	_	_
diffusive	_	_
transport	_	_
model	_	_
because	_	_
(	_	_
1	_	_
)	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
has	_	_
a	_	_
faster	_	_
response	_	_
time	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
is	_	_
consistent	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
documented	_	_
stratigraphic	_	_
data	_	_
,	_	_
(	_	_
2	_	_
)	_	_
there	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
high-amplitude	_	_
spike	_	_
in	_	_
sediment	_	_
flux	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
(	_	_
3	_	_
)	_	_
the	_	_
assumption	_	_
of	_	_
instantaneous	_	_
transport	_	_
is	_	_
difficult	_	_
to	_	_
justify	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
transport	_	_
of	_	_
large	_	_
grain	_	_
sizes	_	_
as	_	_
an	_	_
alluvial	_	_
bedload	_	_
.	_	_

#18
Consequently	_	_
,	_	_
while	_	_
these	_	_
end-member	_	_
models	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_

all	_	_
the	_	_
complexity	_	_
of	_	_
processes	_	_
seen	_	_
in	_	_

,	_	_
we	_	_
argue	_	_
that	_	_
variations	_	_
in	_	_
long-term	_	_
erosional	_	_

In	_	_

Summary	_	_
and	_	_
model	_	_
limitations	_	_
In	_	_
this	_	_
section	_	_
we	_	_
consider	_	_
the	_	_
implications	_	_
of	_	_
our	_	_
model	_	_
outputs	_	_
,	_	_
both	_	_
generally	_	_
for	_	_
interpreting	_	_
sediment	_	_
routing	_	_
system	_	_
response	_	_
to	_	_
boundary	_	_
condition	_	_
change	_	_
and	_	_
specifically	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
context	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
well-studied	_	_
PETM	_	_
event	_	_
.	_	_

#412
While	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
flux	_	_
response	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
models	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
change	_	_
in	_	_
precipitation	_	_
are	_	_
at	_	_
a	_	_
first-order	_	_
level	_	_
broadly	_	_
similar	_	_
,	_	_
there	_	_
are	_	_
four	_	_
key	_	_
differences	_	_
to	_	_
highlight	_	_
.	_	_

#413
First	_	_
,	_	_
starting	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
initial	_	_
conditions	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
transport	_	_
model	_	_
appears	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
more	_	_
sensitive	_	_
to	_	_
precipitation	_	_
change	_	_
than	_	_
the	_	_
equivalent	_	_
stream	_	_
power	_	_
model	_	_
.	_	_

#414
It	_	_
is	_	_
therefore	_	_
a	_	_
good	_	_
candidate	_	_
for	_	_
which	_	_
rapid	_	_
catchment-wide	_	_
responses	_	_
are	_	_
recorded	_	_
to	_	_
,	_	_
for	_	_
example	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
climate	_	_
change	_	_
event	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
we	_	_
argued	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
PETM	_	_
Claret	_	_
Conglomerate	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
Spanish	_	_
Pyrenees	_	_
.	_	_

#415
Second	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
note	_	_
that	_	_
in	_	_
both	_	_
model	_	_
cases	_	_
there	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
quicker	_	_
response	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
wetting	_	_
than	_	_
a	_	_
drying	_	_
event	_	_
,	_	_
something	_	_
which	_	_
has	_	_
not	_	_
been	_	_
well	_	_
established	_	_
or	_	_
demonstrated	_	_
from	_	_
field	_	_
observations	_	_
.	_	_

#416
Nevertheless	_	_
we	_	_
argue	_	_
that	_	_
field	_	_
data	_	_
sets	_	_
,	_	_
including	_	_
PETM	_	_
studies	_	_
,	_	_
may	_	_
already	_	_
have	_	_
recorded	_	_
this	_	_
asymmetry	_	_
,	_	_
although	_	_
it	_	_
may	_	_
not	_	_
have	_	_
been	_	_
recognized	_	_
as	_	_
such	_	_
.	_	_

#417
Third	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
transport	_	_
model	_	_
has	_	_
a	_	_
greater	_	_
magnitude	_	_
of	_	_
peak	_	_
sediment	_	_
flux	_	_
and	_	_
is	_	_
particularly	_	_
sensitive	_	_
to	_	_
catchment	_	_
size	_	_
.	_	_

#418
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
note	_	_
that	_	_
response	_	_
time	_	_
in	_	_
both	_	_
models	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
function	_	_
of	_	_
uplift	_	_
rate	_	_
for	_	_
n	_	_
>	_	_
1	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
means	_	_
that	_	_
in	_	_
such	_	_
cases	_	_
,	_	_
perhaps	_	_
counter-intuitively	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
more	_	_
perturbed	_	_
the	_	_
system	_	_
the	_	_
faster	_	_
it	_	_
responds	_	_
(	_	_
see	_	_
Whittaker	_	_
and	_	_
Boulton	_	_
,	_	_
2012	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#419
However	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
important	_	_
to	_	_
recognize	_	_
that	_	_
in	_	_
deriving	_	_
these	_	_
two	_	_
classic	_	_
end-member	_	_
models	_	_
we	_	_
have	_	_
simplified	_	_
landscape	_	_
evolution	_	_
considerably	_	_
.	_	_

#420

#421
However	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
compare	_	_
the	_	_
two	_	_
models	_	_
we	_	_
have	_	_
specifically	_	_
used	_	_
values	_	_
of	_	_
c	_	_
,	_	_
k	_	_
,	_	_
m	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
δ	_	_
that	_	_
generate	_	_
comparable	_	_
model	_	_
landscapes	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
we	_	_
then	_	_
changed	_	_
the	_	_
precipitation	_	_
rate	_	_
to	_	_
understand	_	_
the	_	_
form	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
response	_	_
.	_	_

#422
No	_	_
model	_	_
incorporates	_	_
all	_	_
the	_	_
complexities	_	_
that	_	_
characterize	_	_

and	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_

inherent	_	_
in	_	_
considering	_	_
erosional	_	_

that	_	_

the	_	_

of	_	_
one	_	_
over	_	_

suggested	_	_
by	_	_

nor	_	_
do	_	_
we	_	_
consider	_	_
coupled	_	_
issues	_	_
of	_	_
vegetation	_	_
turnover	_	_
in	_	_
response	_	_
to	_	_
climate	_	_

which	_	_
may	_	_
a	_	_
play	_	_
an	_	_

role	_	_
in	_	_

#424
Nonetheless	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
significant	_	_
finding	_	_
of	_	_
this	_	_

has	_	_
been	_	_
the	_	_

This	_	_
results	_	_
in	_	_

it	_	_

that	_	_

#445
Using	_	_
