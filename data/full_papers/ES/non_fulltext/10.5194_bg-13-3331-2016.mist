Introduction	_	_
The	_	_
sediments	_	_
of	_	_
freshwater	_	_
systems	_	_
are	_	_
important	_	_
sinks	_	_
of	_	_
atmospheric	_	_
CO2	_	_
assimilated	_	_
through	_	_
photosynthesis	_	_
both	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
aquatic	_	_
and	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
terrestrial	_	_
environments	_	_
(	_	_
Stallard	_	_
,	_	_
1998	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#15
This	_	_
carbon	_	_
sink	_	_
corresponds	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
fraction	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
organic	_	_
carbon	_	_
(	_	_
OC	_	_
)	_	_
that	_	_
reaches	_	_
the	_	_
sediments	_	_
and	_	_
escapes	_	_
mineralization	_	_
by	_	_
heterotrophic	_	_
organisms	_	_
and	_	_
(	_	_
photo	_	_
)	_	_
chemical	_	_
reactions	_	_
,	_	_
remaining	_	_
buried	_	_
(	_	_
accumulated	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

#16
The	_	_
percentage	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
total	_	_
OC	_	_
reaching	_	_
the	_	_
sediments	_	_
that	_	_
is	_	_
actually	_	_
buried	_	_
corresponds	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
OC	_	_
burial	_	_
efficiency	_	_
(	_	_
OCBE	_	_
)	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
system	_	_
(	_	_

)	_	_
.	_	_

#17
OCBE	_	_
,	_	_
thus	_	_
,	_	_
depends	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
processes	_	_
and	_	_
factors	_	_
affecting	_	_
burial	_	_
and	_	_
mineralization	_	_
.	_	_

#18
OCBE	_	_
is	_	_
closely	_	_
negatively	_	_
linked	_	_
to	_	_
mineralization	_	_
:	_	_
processes	_	_
favoring	_	_
mineralization	_	_
tend	_	_
to	_	_
decrease	_	_
burial	_	_
and	_	_
vice	_	_
versa	_	_
.	_	_

the	_	_
mechanisms	_	_
controlling	_	_
the	_	_
carbon	_	_
fluxes	_	_
in	_	_
marine	_	_
sediments	_	_
have	_	_
received	_	_
considerable	_	_

freshwater	_	_
sediments	_	_
have	_	_
only	_	_

What	_	_
is	_	_
known	_	_
about	_	_
freshwater	_	_
sediments	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
OCBE	_	_
tends	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
strongly	_	_
positively	_	_
correlated	_	_
with	_	_
sedimentation	_	_
rates	_	_

of	_	_

This	_	_

,	_	_
for	_	_

why	_	_

to	_	_
