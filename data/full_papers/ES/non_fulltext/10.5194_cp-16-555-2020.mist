and	_	_
these	_	_

can	_	_
be	_	_
taken	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
uncertainty	_	_
around	_	_
the	_	_
annual	_	_

#64
It	_	_
is	_	_
likely	_	_
that	_	_
some	_	_
seasonal	_	_
(	_	_

is	_	_
incorporated	_	_
into	_	_

,	_	_
particularly	_	_
at	_	_
high	_	_
latitudes	_	_
where	_	_
light	_	_

become	_	_

other	_	_

such	_	_

#66
Indeed	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
extent	_	_
of	_	_
these	_	_

is	_	_
debated	_	_
(	_	_
Hollis	_	_

and	_	_
may	_	_

be	_	_
greater	_	_
than	_	_
the	_	_

Sect.	_	_

there	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_
some	_	_
uncertainty	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

records	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
variations	_	_
in	_	_

#68
In	_	_
the	_	_
most	_	_

only	_	_
certain	_	_

are	_	_
being	_	_

To	_	_

the	_	_

that	_	_

,	_	_
we	_	_

#71
This	_	_
represents	_	_
the	_	_
worst	_	_
case	_	_
in	_	_

it	_	_
is	_	_

that	_	_
a	_	_

Additionally	_	_
,	_	_
future	_	_
work	_	_
can	_	_
also	_	_
expand	_	_
upon	_	_
this	_	_
analysis	_	_
by	_	_
including	_	_
more	_	_

trialling	_	_

It	_	_
is	_	_
also	_	_
important	_	_
to	_	_
note	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
models	_	_
used	_	_
here	_	_
are	_	_
of	_	_
relatively	_	_
low	_	_
spatial	_	_
resolution	_	_
,	_	_
meaning	_	_
the	_	_
spatial	_	_
averaging	_	_
of	_	_
temperature	_	_
is	_	_
taken	_	_
over	_	_
a	_	_
very	_	_
large	_	_
area	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
potential	_	_
smaller-scale	_	_
ocean	_	_
changes	_	_
resulting	_	_
from	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_
ocean	_	_
gateways	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
poorly	_	_
represented	_	_

Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
although	_	_
these	_	_
simulations	_	_
are	_	_
likely	_	_
to	_	_
capture	_	_
large-scale	_	_
climate	_	_
phenomena	_	_
,	_	_
clearly	_	_
much	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_
learnt	_	_
in	_	_
future	_	_
research	_	_
from	_	_
using	_	_
higher-resolution	_	_

The	_	_
challenge	_	_
in	_	_
synthesizing	_	_
the	_	_
many	_	_

that	_	_
occurred	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
large	_	_

heterogeneous	_	_
region	_	_
across	_	_
the	_	_

is	_	_
huge	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
this	_	_

that	_	_
