These	_	_

left	_	_

for	_	_

#17
Pomeroy	_	_
(	_	_
1974	_	_
)	_	_
suggested	_	_
that	_	_
bacteria	_	_
and	_	_
protozoa	_	_
in	_	_
pelagic	_	_
ecosystems	_	_
form	_	_
an	_	_
important	_	_

between	_	_

produced	_	_

food	_	_

.	_	_

#18
Following	_	_
studies	_	_
confirmed	_	_
this	_	_
hypothesis	_	_
and	_	_
Azam	_	_
et	_	_
al.	_	_
(	_	_
1983	_	_
)	_	_
named	_	_
this	_	_
pathway	_	_
the	_	_
“microbial	_	_
loop”	_	_
in	_	_
pelagic	_	_
ecosystems	_	_
.	_	_

#19
Later	_	_
,	_	_
Jumars	_	_
et	_	_
al.	_	_
(	_	_
1989	_	_
)	_	_
presented	_	_
a	_	_
provocative	_	_
paper	_	_
in	_	_
which	_	_
this	_	_
theory	_	_
was	_	_
further	_	_
elaborated	_	_
:	_	_
they	_	_
showed	_	_
that	_	_
heterotrophic	_	_
bacteria	_	_
were	_	_
feeding	_	_
not	_	_
only	_	_
on	_	_
phytoplankton-derived	_	_
dissolved	_	_
organic	_	_
carbon	_	_
but	_	_
also	_	_
on	_	_
DOM	_	_
derived	_	_
from	_	_
sloppy	_	_
feeding	_	_
by	_	_
zooplankton	_	_
.	_	_

#20
Lee	_	_
(	_	_
1980	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
Kemp	_	_
(	_	_
1988	_	_
)	_	_
were	_	_
among	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
to	_	_
hypothesize	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
microbial	_	_
loop	_	_
might	speculation	_
also	_	_
be	_	_
occurring	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
,	_	_
although	_	_
possibly	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
more	_	_
complex	_	_
form	_	_
.	_	_

#21
According	_	_
to	_	_
these	_	_
authors	_	_
,	_	_
sediment	_	_
bacteria	_	_
would	_	_
incorporate	_	_
DOM	_	_
via	_	_
their	_	_
membranes	_	_
directly	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
pore	_	_
water	_	_
or	_	_
from	_	_
polymeric	_	_
materials	_	_
and	_	_
particles	_	_
,	_	_
after	_	_
breaking	_	_
them	_	_
down	_	_
to	_	_
more	_	_
simple	_	_
compounds	_	_
using	_	_
exoenzymes	_	_
.	_	_

#22
Bacteria	_	_
would	_	_
then	_	_
become	_	_
food	_	_
for	_	_
protozoans	_	_
and	_	_
metazoans	_	_
and	_	_
thereby	_	_
play	_	_
a	_	_
key	_	_
role	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
transfer	_	_
of	_	_
carbon	_	_
and	_	_
nutrients	_	_
.	_	_

#23
Lee	_	_
(	_	_
1992	_	_
)	_	_
conducted	_	_
14C	_	_
incubation	_	_
experiments	_	_
using	_	_
water	_	_
samples	_	_
from	_	_
an	_	_
enclosed	_	_
marine	_	_
basin	_	_
to	_	_
study	_	_
carbon	_	_
preservation	_	_
under	_	_
oxic	_	_
and	_	_
anoxic	_	_
conditions	_	_
.	_	_

#24
She	_	_
found	_	_
that	_	_
differences	_	_
in	_	_
OM	_	_
decomposition	_	_
rates	_	_
between	_	_
oxic	_	_
and	_	_
anoxic	_	_
settings	_	_
were	_	_
very	_	_
small	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
that	_	_
anoxic	_	_
sediments	_	_
nevertheless	_	_
showed	_	_
high	_	_
OM	_	_
preservation	_	_
.	_	_

#25
Lee	_	_
(	_	_
1992	_	_
)	_	_
suggested	_	_
that	_	_
,	_	_
where	_	_
bacterial	_	_
grazers	_	_
are	_	_
absent	_	_
,	_	_
organic	_	_
matter	_	_
in	_	_
anoxic	_	_
systems	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
sequestered	_	_
as	_	_
bacterial	_	_
biomass	_	_
,	_	_
or	_	_
as	_	_
bacterially	_	_
derived	_	_
products	_	_
.	_	_

#26
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
she	_	_
concluded	_	_
that	_	_
biomass	_	_
and	_	_
biodiversity	_	_
of	_	_
bacterial	_	_
grazers	_	_
may	_	_
explain	_	_
part	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
differences	_	_
in	_	_
carbon	_	_
preservation	_	_
between	_	_
oxic	_	_
and	_	_
anoxic	_	_
settings	_	_
,	_	_
supporting	_	_
the	_	_
idea	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
benthic	_	_
microbial	_	_
loop	_	_
and	_	_
offering	_	_
some	_	_
insights	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
relationships	_	_
between	_	_
bacteria	_	_
and	_	_
their	_	_
grazers	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_

Along	_	_
this	_	_
line	_	_
,	_	_
Ingels	_	_
et	_	_
al.	_	_
(	_	_
2010	_	_
)	_	_
found	_	_
a	_	_
preferential	_	_
uptake	_	_
of	_	_
bacteria	_	_
versus	_	_
phytodetritus-derived	_	_
carbon	_	_
by	_	_
nematodes	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
the	_	_
isotope	_	_
enrichment	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
nematodes	_	_
was	_	_
so	_	_
low	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
authors	_	_
concluded	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
contribution	_	_
of	_	_
nematodes	_	_

was	_	_
limited	_	_

#251
Hence	_	_
,	_	_
even	_	_
though	_	_

might	options	concessive

,	_	_
upwards	_	_
transfer	_	_
of	_	_
bacterial	_	_
derived	_	_
carbon	_	_
via	_	_

Conclusions	_	_
Accumulating	_	_
evidence	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
literature	_	_
and	_	_
our	_	_
experimental	_	_
results	_	_
strongly	_	_
suggest	_	_
that	_	_
bacteria	_	_
are	_	_
a	_	_
carbon	_	_
sink	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
benthic	_	_
food	_	_
web	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
Arabian	_	_
Sea’s	_	_

via	_	_

#259
This	_	_

that	_	_
the	_	_

this	_	_

#260
The	_	_
DOM	_	_

#261
Within	_	_
the	_	_
POM	_	_
pathway	_	_
,	_	_
there	_	_
is	_	_
competition	_	_
for	_	_

what	_	_
