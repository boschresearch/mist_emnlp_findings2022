Introduction	_	_
1.1	_	_
Importance	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
bentho-pelagic	_	_
coupling	_	_
Shallow	_	_
coastal	_	_
waters	_	_
are	_	_
the	_	_
most	_	_
dynamic	_	_
part	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
ocean	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
various	_	_
effects	_	_
of	_	_
natural	_	_
forcing	_	_
and	_	_
anthropogenic	_	_
activities	_	_
;	_	_
they	_	_
are	_	_
characterised	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
processing	_	_
and	_	_
accumulation	_	_
of	_	_
land-derived	_	_
discharges	_	_
(	_	_
nutrients	_	_
,	_	_
pollutants	_	_
,	_	_
etc	_	_
.	_	_

#23
)	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
influence	_	_
not	_	_
only	_	_
the	_	_
coastal	_	_
ecosystem	_	_
but	_	_
also	_	_
the	_	_
adjacent	_	_
deeper	_	_
sea	_	_
areas	_	_
.	_	_

#24
Shallow	_	_
marine	_	_
ecosystems	_	_
often	_	_
differ	_	_
significantly	_	_
from	_	_
those	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
deeper	_	_
parts	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
sea	_	_

#25
One	_	_
important	_	_
reason	_	_
for	_	_
this	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
influence	_	_
of	_	_
sedimentary	_	_
processes	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
pelagic	_	_
ecosystem	_	_
.	_	_

#26
This	_	_
influence	_	_
can	_	_
take	_	_
place	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_
different	_	_
functional	_	_
ways	_	_
,	_	_

At	_	_
the	_	_
sediment–water	_	_

we	_	_
assume	_	_
that	_	_

our	_	_

reason	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_

the	_	_
sediment	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
directly	_	_

but	_	_
we	_	_

from	_	_
which	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
incorporated	_	_

#349
At	_	_
the	_	_
bottom	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_

,	_	_
there	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
two	_	_
possible	_	_
situations	_	_

#350
–	_	_
If	_	_
the	_	_

is	_	_
lower	_	_
than	_	_
the	_	_
critical	_	_
shear	_	_
stress	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
assume	_	_
a	_	_
deposition	_	_
of	_	_
particulate	_	_
material	_	_
.	_	_

#351
This	_	_
sinking	_	_
material	_	_
(	_	_
w	_	_
<	_	_
0	_	_
)	_	_
vanishes	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_

because	_	_
of	_	_

#352
It	_	_
appears	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

#353
–	_	_
If	_	_
the	_	_

,	_	_
particulate	_	_
material	_	_

and	_	_

the	_	_

#354
In	_	_
both	_	_

This	_	_

based	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
limited	_	_
length	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_

cores	_	_
taken	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

#499
We	_	_
do	_	_
,	_	_
however	_	_
,	_	_
describe	_	_
the	_	_
process	_	_
implicitly	_	_
,	_	_
since	_	_
we	_	_
assume	_	_
that	_	_
a	_	_
part	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
organic	_	_
carbon	_	_
which	_	_
leaves	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_

it	_	_
diffuses	_	_

will	_	_
be	_	_
oxidised	_	_
by	_	_
sulfate	_	_
and	_	_
generate	_	_
H2S	_	_
.	_	_

#500
Therefore	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
parameterise	_	_
this	_	_
process	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
conversion	_	_
from	_	_
sulfate	_	_
to	_	_
hydrogen	_	_

#501
As	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_
column	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
distinguish	_	_
six	_	_
different	_	_
classes	_	_
of	_	_
detritus	_	_
with	_	_
different	_	_
basic	_	_
mineralisation	_	_
rates	_	_

#502
Details	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
specific	_	_
choice	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
classes	_	_
are	_	_
given	_	_
in	_	_
Appendix	_	_
B	_	_
.	_	_

#503
These	_	_
rates	_	_
are	_	_
only	_	_
controlled	_	_
by	_	_
temperature	_	_
,	_	_
not	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
specific	_	_
oxidant	_	_
which	_	_
is	_	_
available	_	_
.	_	_

#504
There	_	_
is	_	_
an	_	_
ongoing	_	_
controversy	_	_
as	_	_
to	_	_
what	_	_
determines	_	_
the	_	_
rate	_	_
of	_	_
sedimentary	_	_
carbon	_	_
decay	_	_
and	_	_
whether	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
oxidant	_	_
(	_	_
and	_	_
therefore	_	_
the	_	_
accessible	_	_
energy	_	_
per	_	_
mole	_	_
of	_	_
carbon	_	_
)	_	_
or	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_
the	_	_
detrital	_	_
carbon	_	_

In	_	_
leaving	_	_
out	_	_
the	_	_
explicit	_	_
dependence	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
oxidant	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
favour	_	_
the	_	_
latter	_	_
theory	_	_
;	_	_
we	_	_
chose	_	_
to	_	_
adopt	_	_
the	_	_
decay	_	_
rates	_	_
proposed	_	_
by	_	_
Middelburg	_	_
(	_	_
1989	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
may	_	_
implicitly	_	_
take	_	_
the	_	_
effect	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
oxidant	_	_
into	_	_

.	_	_

#507
We	_	_
include	_	_
this	_	_
by	_	_
introducing	_	_
additional	_	_
state	_	_
variables	_	_

for	_	_
each	_	_
class	_	_

is	_	_
decomposed	_	_

will	_	_
be	_	_
decomposed	_	_
slower	_	_

#508
This	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
because	_	_
the	_	_
material	_	_
itself	_	_
is	_	_
different	_	_
or	_	_
because	_	_
the	_	_
oxidant	_	_
is	_	_

#509
The	_	_
Middelburg	_	_
model	_	_
includes	_	_
both	_	_
effects	_	_

and	_	_
splitting	_	_
them	_	_

mean	_	_
preferring	_	_
one	_	_
theory	_	_

the	_	_
other	_	_

#510
So	_	_
what	_	_
we	_	_
do	_	_
assume	_	_
if	_	_
we	_	_
just	_	_
apply	_	_
the	_	_
Middelburg	_	_
model	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
time	_	_
which	_	_
a	_	_
particle	_	_
spends	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
oxic	_	_
zone	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
anoxic	_	_
zone	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
sulfidic	_	_
zone	_	_
is	_	_
similar	_	_
in	_	_
our	_	_
setting	_	_
to	_	_
Middelburg’s	_	_
experiments	_	_
.	_	_

#511
In	_	_
this	_	_
case	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
Middelburg	_	_
model	_	_
will	_	_
include	_	_
the	_	_
correct	_	_
slowing-down	_	_
of	_	_
degradation	_	_
caused	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
less	_	_
efficient	_	_
oxidant	_	_

Here	_	_

we	_	_
describe	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_
the	_	_
primary	_	_
redox	_	_

indicated	_	_

the	_	_

#516
Oxic	_	_

heterotrophic	_	_

are	_	_
formulated	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

way	_	_
as	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

see	_	_
Sect.	_	_
2.6.4	_	_

#517
The	_	_
next	_	_
pathway	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
reduction	_	_
of	_	_
Mn	_	_
(	_	_
IV	_	_
)	_	_
to	_	_
Mn	_	_
(	_	_
II	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
produces	_	_
dissolved	_	_
manganese	_	_
.	_	_

#518
The	_	_
reduction	_	_
of	_	_
iron	_	_
oxyhydroxides	_	_
should	_	_
produce	_	_
dissolved	_	_

#519
This	_	_
,	_	_
however	_	_

where	_	_

#520
So	_	_
for	_	_
numerical	_	_
reasons	_	_

we	_	_
combine	_	_
these	_	_

with	_	_
the	_	_

#920
The	_	_

is	_	_
that	_	_

show	_	_
strong	_	_

#921
Another	_	_
difference	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_

there	_	_

perhaps	_	_
just	_	_
a	_	_
constant	_	_
offset	_	_

#924

For	_	_

linked	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
constraint	_	_
of	_	_
mass	_	_
conservation	_	_
.	_	_

#1033
Other	_	_
degrees	_	_
of	_	_
freedom	_	_
arise	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_

model	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
supply	_	_

distribution	_	_

would	_	_
be	_	_

by	_	_

deposition	_	_
and	_	_
thus	_	_
determined	_	_
by	_	_

#1035
Apart	_	_
from	_	_

the	_	_
implementation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
model	_	_
in	_	_

#1036
Physically	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
coupling	_	_
between	_	_

would	_	_
be	_	_

the	_	_
fluff	_	_
layer	_	_
and	_	_
its	_	_
erosion	_	_
and	_	_
redeposition	_	_
.	_	_

#1037
Technically	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
coupling	_	_
is	_	_
simplified	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_

The	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_

for	_	_
