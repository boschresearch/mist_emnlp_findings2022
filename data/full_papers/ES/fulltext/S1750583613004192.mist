The	_	_

the	_	_

this	_	_

#312
The	_	_
modeling	_	_
indicates	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
multiple	_	_
layers	_	_
of	_	_
thin	_	_
CO2	_	_
are	_	_
likely	_	_
a	_	_
consequence	_	_
of	_	_
unexpectedly	_	_
low	_	_
threshold	_	_
pressures	_	_
for	_	_
vertical	_	_
migration	_	_
through	_	_
the	_	_

#313
The	_	_
estimated	_	_
threshold	_	_
pressures	_	_
for	_	_
CO2	_	_
,	_	_
at	_	_
around	_	_
50kPa	_	_
,	_	_
are	_	_
approximately	_	_
35-fold	_	_
less	_	_
than	_	_
that	_	_
measured	_	_
on	_	_
a	_	_
sample	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
caprock	_	_

the	_	_
site	_	_
,	_	_
at	_	_
approximately	_	_
1.75MPa	_	_
.	_	_

#314
This	_	_
difference	_	_
is	_	_
most	_	_
plausibly	_	_
explained	_	_
by	_	_
microfracturing	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
shale	_	_
barriers	_	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
CO2	_	_
injection	_	_
at	_	_
Sleipner	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
considered	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
a	_	_
likely	_	_
cause	_	_
of	_	_
fracturing	_	_
.	_	_

#315
It	_	_
is	_	_
postulated	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
fracturing	_	_
occurred	_	_
long	_	_
before	_	_
CO2	_	_
injection	_	_
commenced	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
result	_	_
of	_	_
rapid	_	_
pore	_	_
pressure	_	_
fluctuations	_	_
associated	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
collapse	_	_
of	_	_
thick	_	_
ice	_	_
sheets	_	_
during	_	_
multiple	_	_
episodes	_	_
of	_	_
deglaciation	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
region	_	_
over	_	_
the	_	_
last	_	_
million	_	_
years	_	_
.	_	_

#316
A	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_
independent	_	_
observations	_	_
are	_	_
considered	_	_
to	_	_
support	_	_
this	_	_
hypothesis	_	_

Concerning	_	_

However	_	_

it	_	_

that	_	_
there	_	_
is	_	_
no	_	_
evidence	_	_
of	_	_
CO2	_	_
leaking	_	_
,	_	_
possibly	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
result	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
different	_	_
caprock	_	_
response	_	_
to	_	_
CO2	_	_
retention	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
is	_	_
notably	_	_
thicker	_	_

the	_	_
thin	_	_
shale	_	_

within	_	_
the	_	_

#319
It	_	_
is	_	_
inferred	_	_
that	_	_
similar	_	_
fracture	_	_
networks	_	_
within	_	_
the	_	_
primary	_	_

are	_	_
potentially	_	_
only	_	_
proximal	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
