Besides	_	_

These	_	_

;	_	_
therefore	_	_
,	_	_
when	_	_
considering	_	_
transportation	_	_
processes	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
Ti/Al	_	_
ratio	_	_

Among	_	_

For	_	_
example	_	_
,	_	_
Si	_	_
content	_	_
in	_	_
marine	_	_

lacustrine	_	_

#22
The	_	_
element	_	_
Fe	_	_
may	speculation	_

reflect	_	_
authigenic	_	_

#23
Finally	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
element	_	_
K	_	_
in	_	_

We	_	_
