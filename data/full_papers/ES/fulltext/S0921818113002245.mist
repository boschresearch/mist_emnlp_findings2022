One	_	_
source	_	_
of	_	_

the	_	_
so-called	_	_
"	_	_
paleomagnetic	_	_

In	_	_
the	_	_
simplest	_	_
case	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
pure	_	_
depositional	_	_
remanent	_	_

They	_	_

that	_	_
salinity	_	_

of	_	_
flocs	_	_
that	_	_
can	capability	_

#17
Another	_	_
view	_	_
,	_	_
however	_	_
,	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
previously	_	_
magnetised	_	_
particles	_	_
(	_	_
they	_	_
can	options	_
be	_	_
of	_	_
detrital	_	_
origin	_	_
,	_	_
or	_	_
formed	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
water	_	_
column	_	_
by	_	_

for	_	_
example	_	_
,	_	_
magnetotactic	_	_
bacteria	_	_
)	_	_
fall	_	_
out	_	_
of	_	_
suspension	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
fluid	_	_
and	_	_
are	_	_
simultaneously	_	_
aligned	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
torque	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
geomagnetic	_	_
field	_	_
imposes	_	_
on	_	_
them	_	_
.	_	_

#18
These	_	_
magnetised	_	_
grains	_	_
are	_	_
free	_	_
to	_	_
move	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_
matrix	_	_
until	_	_
the	_	_
non-ferromagnetic	_	_
sediment	_	_
surrounding	_	_
them	_	_
becomes	_	_
so	_	_
consolidated	_	_
that	_	_
they	_	_
can	feasibility	negation
not	_	_
be	_	_
re-aligned	_	_
by	_	_
subsequent	_	_
changes	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
strength	_	_
and	_	_
direction	_	_
of	_	_

geomagnetic	_	_
field	_	_

Thus	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
type	_	_
DRM	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
called	_	_
post-depositional	_	_
remanent	_	_
magnetization	_	_
(	_	_
PDRM	_	_
)	_	_

#20
A	_	_
PDRM	_	_
is	_	_
probably	_	_
locked-in	_	_
over	_	_
a	_	_
range	_	_
of	_	_
depths	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
means	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
primary	_	_
geomagnetic	_	_
field	_	_
signal	_	_
is	_	_
only	_	_
visible	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
smoothed	_	_
signal	_	_
in	_	_
sedimentary	_	_
paleomagnetic	_	_
data	_	_

#21
The	_	_
degree	_	_
of	_	_
signal	_	_
smoothing	_	_
,	_	_
therefore	_	_
,	_	_
depends	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
large	_	_
extent	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
sediment	_	_

rate	_	_

with	_	_
the	_	_
result	_	_
that	_	_
relatively	_	_
short-lived	_	_
features	_	_
in	_	_
geomagnetic	_	_
field	_	_
behaviour	_	_

the	_	_
