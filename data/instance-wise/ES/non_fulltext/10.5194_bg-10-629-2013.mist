The	_	_

is	_	_
that	_	_

uptake	_	_
of	_	_
TPO4	_	_

the	_	_
porewater	_	_

Beggiatoa	_	_
could	capability-speculation	_
conceivably	_	_
take	_	_
up	_	_
TPO4	_	_
directly	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
bottom	_	_

by	_	_
extension	_	_
of	_	_
their	_	_
filaments	_	_
through	_	_
the	_	_
diffusive	_	_
boundary	_	_
layer	_	_

it	_	_
seems	_	_
more	_	_
plausible	_	_
that	_	_
they	_	_
instead	_	_
capitalize	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
porewater	_	_
TPO4	_	_
