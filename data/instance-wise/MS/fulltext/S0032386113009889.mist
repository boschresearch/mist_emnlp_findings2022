However	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
noteworthy	_	_
that	_	_
previous	_	_
modelling	_	_
work	_	_
has	_	_
required	_	_
the	_	_
volume	_	_
fraction	_	_
of	_	_
debonded	_	_
silica	_	_
particles	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
measured	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
fracture	_	_
surfaces	_	_
but	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
present	_	_
paper	_	_
a	_	_
new	_	_
and	_	_
more	_	_
fundamental	_	_
approach	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
proposed	_	_
.	_	_

#6
Here	_	_
finite-element	_	_
modelling	_	_
has	_	_
demonstrated	_	_
that	_	_
once	_	_
one	_	_
silica	_	_
nanoparticle	_	_
debonds	_	_
then	_	_
its	_	_
nearest	_	_
neighbours	_	_
are	_	_
shielded	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
applied	_	_
stress	_	_
field	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
hence	_	_
may	options	negation
not	_	_
debond	_	_
.	_	_

Statistical	_	_
analysis	_	_
showed	_	_
that	_	_

for	_	_
a	_	_
good	_	_

i.e	_	_
.	_	_
random	_	_
,	_	_
dispersion	_	_
of	_	_
nanoparticles	_	_
,	_	_
each	_	_
nanoparticle	_	_
has	_	_
six	_	_
nearest	_	_
neighbours	_	_
,	_	_
so	_	_
only	_	_
one	_	_
in	_	_
seven	_	_
particles	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
predicted	_	_
to	_	_
debond	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
addition	_	_
of	_	_

has	_	_
been	_	_
shown	_	_
to	_	_
improve	_	_
these	_	_
properties	_	_

the	_	_

the	_	_
epoxy	_	_

#21
Another	_	_
advantage	_	_
[	_	_
5,6,8-10	_	_

is	_	_
that	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
their	_	_
very	_	_
small	_	_
size	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
hence	_	_
large	_	_
number	_	_

then	_	_
a	_	_
relatively	_	_
low	_	_
volume	_	_
fraction	_	_
of	_	_
such	_	_
nanoparticles	_	_
can	capability	_
induce	_	_

Furthermore	_	_

the	_	_

It	_	_

Indeed	_	_

(	_	_

#100
It	_	_
