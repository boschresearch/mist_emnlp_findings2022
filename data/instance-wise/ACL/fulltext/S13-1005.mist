results	_	_
(	_	_

snippets	_	_

to	_	_
provide	_	_
context	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
short	_	_
texts	_	_
and	_	_
enrich	_	_
their	_	_
vectors	_	_

the	_	_

The	_	_
second	_	_
approach	_	_
is	_	_
based	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
assumption	_	_
that	_	_
if	_	_
two	_	_
sentences	_	_
or	_	_
other	_	_
short	_	_
text	_	_
sequences	_	_
are	_	_
semantically	_	_
equivalent	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
should	inference	_
be	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
align	_	_
their	_	_
words	_	_
or	_	_
expressions	_	_
.	_	_

#12
The	_	_
alignment	_	_
quality	_	_
can	capability	_
serve	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
similarity	_	_
measure	_	_
.	_	_

#13
This	_	_
technique	_	_
typically	_	_
pairs	_	_
words	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
two	_	_
texts	_	_
by	_	_
maximizing	_	_
the	_	_
summation	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
word	_	_
similarity	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
resulting	_	_
pairs	_	_

)	_	_

#28
For	_	_
this	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
wanted	_	_
a	_	_
metric	_	_
in	_	_
which	_	_
only	_	_
the	_	_
semantics	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
word	_	_
is	_	_
considered	_	_
and	_	_
not	_	_
its	_	_
lexical	_	_
category	_	_
.	_	_

#29
For	_	_
example	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
verb	_	_
“marry”	_	_
should	deontic	_
be	_	_
semantically	_	_
similar	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
noun	_	_
“wife”	_	_
.	_	_

#30
Another	_	_
desiderata	_	_
was	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
metric	_	_
should	deontic	_
give	_	_
highest	_	_
scores	_	_
and	_	_
lowest	_	_
scores	_	_
in	_	_
its	_	_
range	_	_
to	_	_
similar	_	_
and	_	_
non-similar	_	_
words	_	_
,	_	_
respectively	_	_
.	_	_

#31
In	_	_
this	_	_
section	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
describe	_	_
how	_	_

combining	_	_

Examples	_	_

that	_	_
the	_	_
metric	_	_

while	_	_
the	_	_

call	_	_
the	_	_

as	_	_
