Even	_	_

that	_	_
the	_	_

Regarding	_	_

the	_	_

There	_	_
may	_	_
be	_	_
several	_	_
reasons	_	_
why	_	_
this	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
case	_	_
.	_	_

#151
Firstly	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
must	deontic-rhetorical	_
remember	_	_
that	_	_
research	_	_
has	_	_
shown	_	_
that	_	_
MT	_	_
output	_	_
results	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
lower	_	_
lexical	_	_
variety	_	_
as	_	_
compared	_	_
with	_	_
manual	_	_
translation	_	_
(	_	_
Toral	_	_
,	_	_
2019	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
indicates	_	_
a	_	_
tendency	_	_
to	_	_
reduce	_	_
the	_	_
vocabulary	_	_
produced	_	_
.	_	_

#152
Secondly	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
must	deontic-rhetorical	_
also	_	_
bear	_	_
in	_	_
mind	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
task	_	_
carried	_	_
out	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
participants	_	_
involved	_	_
writing	_	_
a	_	_
short	_	_
piece	_	_
of	_	_
fiction	_	_
.	_	_

#153
It	_	_
is	_	_
possible	_	_
that	_	_
,	_	_
given	_	_
the	_	_
limited	_	_
size	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
text	_	_
,	_	_
lexical	_	_
diversity	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
the	_	_
optimum	_	_
metric	_	_
to	_	_
account	_	_
for	_	_
complexity	_	_
.	_	_

#175
Also	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
presence	_	_
of	_	_
objects	_	_
and	_	_
predicative	_	_
complements	_	_
is	_	_
higher	_	_
when	_	_
writing	_	_
directly	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
foreign	_	_
language	_	_
.	_	_

#176
However	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
must	deontic-rhetorical	_
concede	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
latter	_	_
are	_	_
often	_	_
compulsory	_	_
elements	_	_
required	_	_
by	_	_
transitive	_	_
verbs	_	_
,	_	_
whereas	_	_
modifiers	_	_
and	_	_
conjunction	_	_
can	_	_
be	_	_
freely	_	_
used	_	_
to	_	_
produce	_	_
more	_	_
elaborate	_	_
text	_	_
.	_	_

#177
As	_	_
a	_	_
result	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
could	_	_
argue	_	_
that	_	_
writing	_	_
in	_	_
their	_	_
language	_	_
of	_	_
instruction	_	_
and	_	_
using	_	_
MT	_	_
to	_	_
translate	_	_
it	_	_
into	_	_
the	_	_
foreign	_	_
language	_	_
is	_	_
allowing	_	_
participants	_	_
to	_	_
produce	_	_
more	_	_
complex	_	_
structures	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
certain	_	_
degree	_	_
.	_	_

#212
Even	_	_
when	_	_
we	_	_
must	deontic-rhetorical	_
remember	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
optimisation	_	_
logic	_	_
used	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
TER	_	_
metric	_	_
does	_	_
not	_	_
always	_	_
match	_	_
the	_	_
linguistic	_	_
intuition	_	_
used	_	_
by	_	_
users	_	_
when	_	_
editing	_	_
text	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
worth	_	_
considering	_	_
the	_	_
edit	_	_
types	_	_
calculated	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_

#213
We	_	_
see	_	_
that	_	_
