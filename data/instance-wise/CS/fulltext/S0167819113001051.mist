A	_	_

#24
From	_	_
the	_	_
outset	_	_
the	_	_
intention	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
to	_	_
allocate	_	_
one	_	_
core	_	_
on	_	_
each	_	_
SoC	_	_
entirely	_	_
to	_	_
system	_	_
management	_	_
;	_	_
if	_	_
this	_	_
eventually	_	_
proves	_	_
insufficient	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
simple	_	_
to	_	_
delegate	_	_
a	_	_
second	_	_
core	_	_
to	_	_
this	_	_
task	_	_
.	_	_

#25
Cores	_	_
devoted	_	_
to	_	_
system	_	_
management	_	_
can	capability	_
identify	_	_
and	_	_
map	_	_
around	_	_
failed	_	_
devices	_	_
at	_	_
run	_	_
time	_	_
.	_	_

#26
Particular	_	_
attention	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
paid	_	_
to	_	_
inter-chip	_	_
communications	_	_
where	_	_
link	_	_
failures	_	_
or	_	_
transient	_	_
congestion	_	_
may	feasibility-options	_
be	_	_
routed	_	_
around	_	_
rapidly	_	_
without	_	_
software	_	_
intervention	_	_
.	_	_

#27
Finally	_	_
some	_	_
more	_	_
conventional	_	_
techniques	_	_
-	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
automatic	_	_
CRC	_	_
generation	_	_
and	_	_
checking	_	_
and	_	_
watchdog	_	_
timers	_	_
-	_	_
are	_	_
employed	_	_
in	_	_
each	_	_
processing	_	_
node	_	_
.	_	_

#54
If	_	_
a	_	_
component	_	_
does	_	_
not	_	_
respond	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
predetermined	_	_
amount	_	_
of	_	_
time	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
watchdog	_	_
will	_	_
apply	_	_
'soft	_	_
'	_	_
reset	_	_

,	_	_
only	_	_
resorting	_	_
to	_	_
'hard	_	_
'	_	_
reset	_	_
if	_	_
this	_	_
fails	_	_
.	_	_

#55
If	_	_
both	_	_
resets	_	_
fail	_	_
the	_	_
watchdog	_	_
will	_	_
mark	_	_
the	_	_
component	_	_
as	_	_
faulty	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
System	_	_
Controller	_	_
so	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
Monitor	_	_
Process	_	_
can	capability	_
switch	_	_
it	_	_
off	_	_

#56
SpiNNaker	_	_
's	_	_
fault	_	_
tolerance	_	_
relies	_	_
mainly	_	_
on	_	_
redundancy	_	_
:	_	_
18	_	_
cores	_	_
,	_	_
6	_	_
output	_	_
links	_	_
,	_	_
2	_	_
PLLs	_	_
(	_	_
phase	_	_
locked	_	_
loops	_	_
)	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
memory	_	_
subsystem	_	_
.	_	_

#57
The	_	_
main	_	_
strength	_	_
of	_	_
this	_	_
redundancy	_	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
components	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
have	_	_
their	_	_
identifiers	_	_
hard-coded	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
therefore	_	_
the	_	_
functionality	_	_
of	_	_
one	_	_
component	_	_
can	feasibility	_
be	_	_
covered	_	_
seamlessly	_	_
by	_	_
any	_	_
redundant	_	_
one	_	_
.	_	_

#58
Practically	_	_
,	_	_
this	_	_
means	_	_
that	_	_
critical	_	_
components	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
Monitor	_	_
Processor	_	_
are	_	_
extremely	_	_
reliable	_	_
.	_	_

#72
Packets	_	_
are	_	_
multicast	_	_
routed	_	_
in	_	_
hardware	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
on-chip	_	_
routers	_	_
replicating	_	_
them	_	_
as	_	_
necessary	_	_
to	_	_
reach	_	_
all	_	_
their	_	_
destinations	_	_
.	_	_

#73
Given	_	_
that	_	_
digital	_	_
electronics	_	_
are	_	_
orders	_	_
of	_	_
magnitude	_	_
faster	_	_
than	_	_
the	_	_
biological	_	_

-	_	_
for	_	_

,	_	_
biological	_	_
spikes	_	_
are	_	_
propagated	_	_
through	_	_
an	_	_
axon	_	_
for	_	_
up	_	_
to	_	_
20ms	_	_
while	_	_
transmitting	_	_
a	_	_
packet	_	_
through	_	_
the	_	_
SpiNNaker	_	_

a	_	_

it	_	_
is	_	_
possible	_	_
to	_	_

many	_	_

onto	_	_
a	_	_

the	_	_
consequence	_	_

#77
Firstly	_	_
the	_	_

itself	_	_
is	_	_
robust	_	_
against	_	_
minor	_	_
perturbations	_	_
in	_	_

Secondly	_	_

there	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
huge	_	_
hardware	_	_

available	_	_
which	_	_
provides	_	_
a	_	_
high	_	_
degree	_	_
of	_	_
redundancy	_	_

#79
Although	_	_
each	_	_

18	_	_
cores	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
intended	_	_

any	_	_
specific	_	_
number	_	_
of	_	_

,	_	_
merely	_	_
(	_	_
any	_	_

one	_	_

Performance	_	_

Our	_	_

was	_	_
compared	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
conventional	_	_
unit	_	_
.	_	_

#285
Both	_	_
circuits	_	_
were	_	_
simulated	_	_
in	_	_
Verilog	_	_
handling	_	_
roughly	_	_
a	_	_
million	_	_
packets	_	_
each	_	_
in	_	_
an	_	_
extremely	_	_
noisy	_	_
environment	_	_
in	_	_
which	_	_

have	_	_
a	_	_
50	_	_

probability	_	_
of	_	_
being	_	_
affected	_	_
by	_	_
a	_	_
glitch	_	_
.	_	_

#286
This	_	_
noise	_	_
level	_	_

thus	_	_
the	_	_
number	_	_

not	_	_

The	_	_

of	_	_
the	_	_

the	_	_

roughly	_	_
10	_	_
%	_	_
more	_	_

#294
This	_	_
is	_	_
acceptable	_	_
as	_	_

should	inference	_
be	_	_
rare	_	_
