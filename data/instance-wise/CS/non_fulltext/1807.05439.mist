that	_	_
both	_	_

perform	_	_

However	_	_
,	_	_
while	_	_
paired	_	_

#152
Therefore	_	_
we	_	_
come	_	_
up	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
design	_	_
for	_	_
unsupervised	_	_
learning	_	_

First	_	_
,	_	_
since	_	_
the	_	_
network	_	_
architecture	_	_
contains	_	_
an	_	_
encoder	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
decoder	_	_
with	_	_
skip	_	_
connections	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
glossy-to-Lambertian	_	_
image	_	_
translation	_	_
is	_	_
limited	_	_
to	_	_
images	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
fixed	_	_
resolution	_	_
.	_	_

#258
This	_	_
resolutions	_	_
might	speculation	_
be	_	_
too	_	_
low	_	_
for	_	_
certain	_	_
types	_	_
of	_	_
applications	_	_

#259
Next	_	_
,	_	_
due	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
variability	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
background	_	_
in	_	_
real	_	_
images	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
translation	_	_
network	_	_
might	options-speculation	_
treat	_	_
a	_	_
portion	_	_

the	_	_
background	_	_
as	_	_
part	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
reconstructed	_	_
object	_	_
.	_	_

#260
Similarly	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
network	_	_
occasionally	_	_
misclassifies	_	_
the	_	_
