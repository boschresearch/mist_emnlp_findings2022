Please cite this paper if using the dataset or the code, and direct any questions regarding the dataset and code at [Sophie Henning](mailto:sophieelisabeth.henning@de.bosch.com). The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07156).

## Purpose of this Software 

This software is a research prototype, solely developed for and published as part of the publication cited above. It will neither be maintained nor monitored in any way.

## Data
We release **Modals in Scientific Text** (MiST), a dataset to foster research on functions of modal verbs in English scientific text. In scientific writing, modal verbs are a popular lingustic device to hedge statements, but they are also used, e.g., to denote capabilities. Hence, decoding their function is important, e.g., for extracting information from scientific text.

MiST covers papers from five scientific domains (computational linguistics, materials science, agriculture, computer science, and earth science) and contains 3,737 manually annotated modal verb instances.

For more details on the annotation scheme and dataset construction, please refer to the paper.
Further information on how the data is stored can be found in [data/README.md](data/README.md).
